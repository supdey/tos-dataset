Please also read our Privacy Policy and Copyright and IP Policy
By using the Site and the Services (defined below), whether on a desktop computer or mobile device, (even if you're just visiting), you are agreeing to the Terms, Privacy Policy and Copyright and IP Policy posted at the time of your visit
About Us Photobucket offers image storage, hosting, sharing and searching services as well as printing services (collectively referred to as the " Services ") that are offered via the Site and our mobile app services, as well as sites provided by our vendors
Our Customers The Site is open to anyone 16 years of age or older , but some of the Services are only available to those people (" Subscribers ") who have created either a Free Trial Account, a Free Account or a Paid Account (collectively, " Account ")
You can visit the Site to search for images without registering as a Subscriber but with our free and paid account options that offer so many Services, we believe you will find the plan that is right for you! Subscriber Responsibilities When you become a Subscriber, you agree to the following: You have provided true information when you registered to be a Subscriber and created an Account; You have given us a valid email address, that you will be required to confirm upon registration, and/or any time thereafter, via a confirming e-mail which will require a response; to complete your registration or keep your Account active; You will notify us if something changes; You are 16 years of age or older; You are not breaking any laws when you use the Services; You will not resell any of the Services; and You will not violate these Terms as a Subscriber
If you become a Subscriber, you are responsible for the "Content" (defined below) and activities in your Account, for protecting your Content with a secure password and not sharing your password with anyone
We recommend using a combination of numbers, symbols and lower and upper case letters to create a secure password
Photobucket reserves the right to suspend, restrict or terminate your Account at any time (even if you've paid for a monthly or annual subscription at the time of such action), without warning for any violation of these Terms, with or without prior notice or explanation and without liability , and can even take legal action if needed
Termination of your Account may include, in Photobucket's sole discretion, permanently removing your Content without warning
For example, we may terminate your Account if you infringe the intellectual property rights of others, if you violate our community standards or if you commit illegal acts using the Site or Servicesâ€”although we may, in our discretion, instead deny, restrict or suspend access to all or any part of the Site, or Services or suspend, restrict or terminate your Account when something similar occurs
If you are over your allotted storage limit, Photobucket may suspend your Account until you take certain actions as described herein or terminate your Account
You may cease use of the Services at any time
Even after you are no longer a Subscriber, you will still be responsible for the promises you have made to us about your Content
You'll be responsible for any damages that result from breaking your promises as further outlined below
Types of Accounts, Pricing and Limits Visiting: There is no cost to visit the Site for the purpose of conducting image searches
You may also be able to share links to content uploaded by other Site Subscribers who have marked their Content as "public"
Free Trial Account: Photobucket offers a limited free trial account that allows for the unlimited (see below) upload of Content, use of the image editor and the ability to share (but not third-party image host) Content
Once a Free Trial Account is activated, you will have 21 days to explore the website, upload images and use our most popular tools
You will not be required to provide a payment method to set up or use a Free Trial Account
At the end of the 21-day free trial period, you will have the option to purchase a Paid Account (see below) or convert to a Free (Limited) Account (see below), with all the restrictions that apply
THE FREE TRIAL ACCOUNT ALLOWS FOR THE UNLIMITED UPLOAD & STORAGE OF CONTENT DURING THE FREE TRIAL PERIOD SUBJECT TO THE LIMITATION THAT SUCH CONTENT MUST BE SOLELY OWED BY THE INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNT HOLDER AND MUST NOT BE CONTENT USED IN ANY WAY FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES
PHOTOBUCKET SHALL, IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION, DETERMINE THE REASONABLENESS OF THE SIZE AND NUMBER OF CONTENT IMAGES AND/OR VIDEOS UPLOADED AND STORED BY YOU AND SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO IMPOSE LIMITATIONS AS IT DEEMS APPROPRIATE
Free (Limited) Account: The Free (Limited) Account provides a limited amount of Content storage, which is based upon the lesser of a given amount of storage space, expressed in gigabytes, and total image count
For example, if the restriction is 2.5GB or 250 images, you will not be able to upload any additional images once one of these two thresholds is reached
If your account exceeds the above limits, the images in your account that exceed the storage limit will be blurred or otherwise made unavailable to you
Our free account does not allow for third party image hosting or use of our image editor
IF A FREE ACCOUNT SUBSCRIBER EXCEEDS THEIR ALLOTTED STORAGE WHICH IS DETERMINED BASED UPON THE LESSER OF A GIVEN AMOUNT OF STORAGE SPACE EXPRESSED IN GIGABYTES AND TOTAL IMAGE COUNT, THEY MAY: UPGRADE TO A PAID ACCOUNT BY SELECTING THE APPROPRIATE PAID ACCOUNT SUBSCRIPTION LEVEL, REDUCE THE NUMBER OF IMAGES IN THEIR LIBRARY TO GET BELOW THEIR ALLOTTED STORAGE OR CLOSE THEIR FREE ACCOUNT
ALTERNATIVELY, PHOTOBUCKET MAY TERMINATE THE SUBSCRIBER'S ACCOUNT AND PERMANENTLY DELETE THEIR CONTENT UPON THEIR REQUEST
THE FREE ACCOUNT DOES NOT ALLOW IMAGE HOSTING
TO THE EXTENT THAT IN OUR SOLE AND ABSOLUTE DISCRETION, WE ALLOW A FREE ACCOUNT TO HOST AN IMAGE, THE IMAGE WILL INCLUDE A PHOTOBUCKET WATERMARK THAT REFLECTS THAT THE IMAGE IS HOSTED FOR FREE BY US
IF WE PERMIT ANY FREE IMAGE HOSTING, WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO BLOCK THE IMAGE OR BLUR AND WATRMARK THE IMAGE IN OUR SOLE AND ABSOLUTE DISCRETION
FREE ACCOUNT HOLDERS ARE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO UPGRADE TO A PAID ACCOUNT THAT PERMITS THIRD PARTY HOSTING
Paid Account: Photobucket offers several paid options that give the Subscriber more storage, image hosting and other services
Please note that Paid Accounts are billed either monthly or annually at your option
If your paid account exceeds the storage limit associated with your paid account, the images in your account that exceed your storage limit may be blurred
IF A PAID ACCOUNT EXCEEDS ITS ALLOTTED STORAGE CAPACITY WHICH IS DETERMINED BASED UPON THE LESSER OF A GIVEN AMOUNT OF STORAGE SPACE EXPRESSED IN GIGABYTES AND TOTAL IMAGE COUNT, THE SUBSCRIBER MAY: UPGRADE TO A HIGHER LEVEL PAID ACCOUNT BY SELECTING THE APPROPRIATE PAID ACCOUNT SUBSCRIPTION LEVEL, REDUCE THE NUMBER OF IMAGES IN THEIR ACCOUNT TO GET UNDER THEIR ALLOTTED STORAGE CAPACITY OR CLOSE THEIR CURRENT PAID ACCOUNT
ALTERNATIVELY, PHOTOBUCKET MAY TERMINATE THE SUBSCRIBER'S ACCOUNT AND PERMANENTLY DELETE THEIR CONTENT UPON THEIR REQUEST
THE INTERMEDIATE AND EXPERT LEVEL PLANS ARE THE ONLY PAID ACCOUNTS THAT OFFER UNLIMITED (SEE DEFINITION, BELOW) IMAGE HOSTING
THE BEGINNER PLAN OFFERS THE SAME HOSTING BENEFITS AS THE FREE ACCOUNT (SEE FREE ACCOUNT INFO ABOVE FOR DETAILS)
NOTE: "UNLIMITED" DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT YOU CAN USE AN EXCESSIVE AMOUNT OF BANDWIDTH PER DAY OR PER MONTH OR OTHER MEASURING PERIOD IN OUR DISCRETION

Content and Service Limits Photobucket continues to grow and get better because of users like you
If you are a Subscriber, you can upload image files of any, number, size or quality ( "Content" )
However, here are some limitations: File Size and Bandwidth Limits: The file size, bandwidth and amount of storage you have are based on your Account level
Types of Content Limits; Our Community Standards: At Photobucket, we strive to create a place where everyone feels welcome, so please be mindful of others
We are committed to not censoring content but will remove content that falls under one of the following categories: Obscenity (nudity is acceptable but no explicit content) Fighting words Defamation (including libel and slander) Child pornography Perjury Blackmail Incitement to imminent lawless action True threats Solicitations to commit crimes Seeks personal information of others Spam or is otherwise illegal Additionally, please do not upload Content you didn't create unless you have the written permission of the creator prior to uploading
Content & Privacy You retain all your rights to any Content you submit, upload or display on or while using Photobucket
This means that you own all the Content you post and are responsible for its settings: You can mark any Content you upload as "private." Content marked "private" will not show up in public search results on the Site and only users you have given access will be able to view the Content
Although we have created measures to protect your privacy, please be aware that just because something is marked "private," does not mean that only the people you invite will see it
Users may still be able to find the direct URL for a photo or through other search mechanisms, and then share or link to it outside the Site
When you upload Content marked as "private", you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, right and license to: copy, stream, post, display and reproduce the Content so that we may offer our Services to you and to others at your request (e.g
image sharing and hosting by you)
Please remember, if you share Content from the Site or provide someone with a direct link to Content, others may be able to see it, even if you marked it "private" on the Site
We are not responsible for any shared Content that has been shared after being marked as "private." If you close your account and request that we delete your Content (by contacting us at support@photobucket.com ), we will remove your Content from the Site (unless we are legally obligated to maintain it for any reason)
If you close your account and do not make such a written request, we may, in our sole discretion, either maintain or delete your images
See Privacy Policy for details
If you mark Content as "private" that was previously marked "public", Photobucket will promptly hide it from search results on the Site
Note that all Content uploaded by you, whether designated as "public" or "private" may be stored by us as backup files or on servers for many reasons even after you delete or change privacy settings, and we may retain and use it as needed for our own internal purposes, such as improving our (and our vendors') image tagging capabilities
When you upload Content marked as "public", you grant us a worldwide, non- exclusive, royalty-free, right and license to: copy, convey, distribute, stream, post, publicly display (e.g
post it elsewhere), reproduce and create derivative works from it (meaning things based on it), whether in print or any kind of electronic version that exists now or is later developed, for any purpose, including a commercial purpose with the right to sublicense such rights to others
By making your Content public, you are also giving all other Site users the right to copy, distribute, publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce and create derivative works from it via the Site, third party websites or applications (for example, via services allowing Subscribers to order prints of Content or t- shirts and similar items containing Content, and via social media websites), provided such use is not for a commercial purpose
By uploading, you are confirming that the Content is yoursâ€”no one else'sâ€”and that the uploading and use of your Content does not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights, intellectual property rights or human rights of somebody else
If we learn that you are infringing others' rights or are using Content that is not yours, Photobucket has the right to remove this Content and you agree that you are responsible for any costs associated with the infringement
Photobucket may manipulate and display your Content as well as obtain image tagging from our vendors to offer the Services (including transcoding and/or reformatting Content) to allow its use throughout the Services
Photobucket has the right to place advertising, promotions, notifications or identifiers, banners and watermarks on or near your Content as well as blur or block your hosted images in the event that you have exceeded our bandwidth limitations described elsewhere in these Terms, and how and what are up to us
Photobucket may moderate Content
However, we are not responsible for what you have uploaded and we are under no obligation to modify or remove any inappropriate Content
We have provided some tools on the Site, such as links to "flag as inappropriate," so you can let us know if you find Content offensive
As a general rule, we allow "not safe for work" aka "NSFW" Content subject to our community standards set forth in these Terms
We reserve the right to change the designation of your Content and/or albums from "public" to "private"
We will not, however, change your "private" setting on your Content or albums to "public" without you asking us to do so on your behalf
If you stop using the Services, your Content may remain on the Site unless you actively remove your Content, and the rights you granted to us and other Site users remain
Notwithstanding, Photobucket may archive or delete your Content in its sole discretion, subject to our Bill of Rights and these Terms
In order to continue to improve the Site and Services, we may use software and other things on the Site that we own or that have been licensed to us ("Photobucket Software")
Photobucket has also created the look, feel and architecture of the Site and has posted certain images and videos ("Photobucket Content")
Together the Photobucket Content and Photobucket Software are the "Photobucket Materials." Photobucket Materials are ours and remain ours
