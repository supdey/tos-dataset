This Privacy Policy discloses the privacy practices for www.politico.com (“POLITICO”), www.politicopro.com (“POLITICO PRO”), and any other sites that display authorized links to this policy, including all mobile websites (collectively with POLITICO and POLITICO PRO, each a “Site”) and applications (each an “Application”) associated therewith, provided by POLITICO LLC (“POLITICO LLC”, “we” or “us”)
For individuals in the EU using the Site or Application, POLITICO LLC, located at 1000 Wilson Blvd, 8th Floor, Arlington, VA, 22209, is considered to be the controller of your data

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully so that you understand our privacy practices
By browsing a Site; installing, downloading, or using an Application; and/or providing your information to us in any other way, you understand that we will collect, use, and disclose your information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy
Questions regarding privacy issues should be directed to us at privacy@politico.com or at the address above
The information we gather falls into three categories: (1) information voluntarily supplied by users; (2) information automatically gathered; and (3) information we collect from third parties
Categories of personal information we collect 
Throughout this Policy, we discuss in detail the specific pieces of personal information we collect from and about users
The California Consumer Protection Act (“CCPA”) requires us to provide you with the “categories” of personal information we collect
The categories we collect are: identifiers (such as name, address, email address, IP address, device identifiers, and login information); commercial information (such as subscription and delivery history); financial data (such as credit card information); internet or other network or device activity (such as browsing history or what content you access on our Sites or Applications); geolocation information (e.g., your city and state based on IP address or precise location information from your mobile device with your consent and consistent with your mobile device settings); professional or employment related data; potentially protected classifications (such as gender, nationality, and age); physical characteristics or description (such as when you voluntarily submit a photo to our Site or Application); and other information that identifies or can be reasonably associated with you (such as information you make available on message boards or through email)
We and our service providers may use the categories of personal information we collect from and about you consistent with the various business purposes and commercial we discuss throughout this Policy
Please see the relevant section(s) for more information

When you register as a POLITICO member, we collect information including your name, company, title, zip code, e-mail address, password, and information regarding newsletters and author alerts you would like to receive
When you request information about POLITICO PRO subscriptions, we collect information including your name, e-mail address, title, job type, phone number, organization name, organization type, country, industry field of interest, interested products, and locations of interest

When you respond to our surveys, we will collect all the information requested in the surveys, including any applicable contact information and demographic information such as your e-mail, first name, last name, location, place of employment, type of employment, industry, household income, race, age, and gender
We also collect information at other points in our Sites and Application which state information is being collected
You do not have a statutory obligation to provide us with your information
If you are a POLITICO PRO subscriber, you have a contractual obligation to provide us with information necessary to enter into a subscription agreement and provide the POLITICO PRO services to you
If you are not a POLITICO PRO subscriber, you do not have a contractual obligation to provide us with your information, but if you do not, we may not be able to provide you with services you have requested or you may be limited in your use of our services (e.g., if you do not provide us with your e-mail address, we will not be able to send you newsletters)
Information Automatically Collected We also may collect and store information that is generated automatically as you navigate through our Sites or Applications
To make our Sites and Applications more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third-party service provider) may collect information from your computer or device, including but not limited to: The date and time of your visit and the web pages and content you view and links you click on while navigating within our Sites or Applications; Information about the type of content accessed via our Sites or Applications; The site you visited before and after visiting our Sites; Your Internet Protocol (IP) address (a numerical address assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider so that other computers connected to the Internet can communicate with you online) that can sometimes be used to derive your general geographic area; Search terms you enter using our Sites or Applications; Unique identifiers, including non-global mobile device identification numbers; Information about your computer device such as your device type, screen size, browser type, language and other settings, memory capacity, plug-ins, Internet domain, TCP configuration parameters, operating system, carrier code, time zone and the names, versions and package IDs of software installed on your device; and Information collected through cookies, pixel tags and other tracking technologies (see additional descriptions of these terms below)
If you allow our Application to have access to your location information and you have enabled location services on your phone, we collect your precise location information
Information Collected from Third Parties We may also collect information about you through non-affiliated third parties, such as market research firms and public sources
Depending on the source, this information collected from third parties could include information such as demographic information and brand and media consumption information
We may combine information that we collect about you through the Sites and Applications with information that we obtain from such third parties
Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies To help make the Sites and Applications more responsive to the needs of users, we employ a standard software feature, called a "cookie," to assign each user a unique, random number that resides on a user's computer or device
The cookie by itself does not personally identify the user; it merely identifies the computer or device with which the user accesses a Site or Application
Cookies help us track user trends and patterns
They also prevent you from having to re-enter your preferences on certain areas of a Site or Application where you have entered preference information before
When we post videos, third parties may use local shared objects, known as flash cookies to store your preferences for volume control or to personalize certain video features
Flash cookies are different from cookies because of the amount and type of data and how the data is stored
We also may use web beacons (also known as "pixel tags") to access cookies and to count users who visit our Sites, use our Applications, or open our HTML-formatted e-mail messages
Pixel tags are graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, that are used to track online movements of our users
In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, pixel tags are embedded invisibly in web pages and e-mail messages
We may collect information about your interactions with our e-mail messages, such as the links you click on and whether you open or forward a message, the date and time of these interactions and the device you use to read our e-mails
Our website may also feature Nielsen proprietary measurement software, which will allow users to contribute to market research
To learn more about the information that Nielsen software may collect and your choices with regard to it, please see the Nielsen Digital Measurement Privacy Policy
Analytics Services We use third-party analytics services (“Analytics Services”), to help analyze how users use our Sites and Applications
The information generated by the cookies or other technologies about your use of our Sites and/or Applications (the “Analytics Information”) is transmitted to the Analytics Services
The Analytics Services use Analytics Information to compile reports on user activity
The Analytics Services may also transfer the Analytics Information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process Analytics Information on their behalf
Each Analytics Service’s ability to use and share Analytics Information is restricted by such Analytics Service’s terms of use and privacy policy
By using a Site or Application, you consent to the processing of data about you by Analytics Services in the manner and for the purposes set out above
For a full list of our Analytics Services, please contact us at feedback@politico.com
We also collect anonymized, cookie-based demographics data from third parties to analyze the composition of our audience
Tailored Advertising Our Site also makes use of various third-party cookie data collection and linking services
POLITICO and third-party vendors, including Google, Teads and others, may use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookies) and third-party cookies (such as the Google Ad Manager cookie) together to (i) inform, optimize, and serve ads based on your past visits to our website and (ii) report how your ad impressions, uses of ad services, and interactions with the foregoing are related to your visits to the Site
In addition, we may use Google Analytics data, including but not limited to, geographic, demographics, and interest reporting information to recognize and understand user preferences, make improvements, and for other business purposes
You can learn more about how Google manages data in its ads products, through which you can learn how to opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, by visiting the Google Ads Settings page
Learn more about how Teads uses data
We also may use third-party advertising companies to target and serve some of the advertisements that appear on our Sites and Applications, and these companies likewise may use their own cookies, web beacons and similar technologies to collect information about users of our Sites and Applications
These companies may use that information, to deliver advertisements on this Site, and possibly on other websites (if the third-party advertising company operates an advertising network), tailored to match the perceived interests of consumers
The collection and use of information by these companies is governed by the relevant third party's privacy policy and is not covered by our privacy policy
If you would like more information about this practice, or if you would like information on how to opt out of these information collection practices, you may visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out link, the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out link or European Digital Advertising Alliance Your Online Choices to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs
Notice Concerning Do Not Track Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers
We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for third party purposes, and that is why we provide the variety of opt-out mechanisms listed above
However, we do not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals
To learn more about Do Not Track, you can do so here

For instance, when you respond to a survey, we may use, disclose and/or publish the responses you provide to us
However, we will not publish or disclose your name in connection with your response without your prior consent

To the extent those laws apply, our legal grounds for processing your personal data are as follows: · To Honor Our Contractual Commitments to You
