An application data cache is a data repository on a device
It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an Internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device
When used in 'local storage' mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions
This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and re-opened
One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website
When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognise your browser

A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services
For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers and smartphones are all considered devices
You may access some of our services by signing up for a Google Account and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address and a password)
This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorised access by others
You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address
These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks
An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or refers to an individually identifiable user
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened
Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination web page by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page
The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last web page the browser visited
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs or sexuality
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites
These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser
A typical log entry for a search for 'cars' looks like this: 123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 - http://www.google.com/search?q=cars - Firefox 1.0.7; Windows NT 5.1 - 740674ce2123e969 123.45.67.89 is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP
Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet
25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 is the date and time of the query
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars is the requested URL, including the search query
Firefox 1.0.7; Windows NT 5.1 is the browser and operating system being used
740674ce2123a969 is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google
(Cookies can be deleted by users
If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device)
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app or device
Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users and how they can be accessed
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences and providing personalised advertising
For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language
You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent
Learn more about how Google uses cookies 
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognise a specific device or app on that device
For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be managed in your device’s settings
Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone
For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customise our service to your device or analyse device issues related to our services
For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web
We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for 'pizza'
Learn more about Google ads and why you may see particular ads 
For example, advertisers may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can better understand the performance of their ad campaigns
We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don’t reveal information about individual people

For example, we may anonymise data, or encrypt data to ensure it can’t be linked to other information about you
Learn more Some examples of how we combine the information we collect include: When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content that you have in other Google products, such as Gmail or Google Calendar
This can include things such as the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant and hotel reservations or your photos
Learn more If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by auto-completing their email address when you start to type in their name
This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know
Learn more The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalised content, depending on your settings
For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, for example sports scores, based on your activity
Learn more If you link your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant
For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight or send information such as driving directions to your phone
Learn more For example, when you’re signed in to your Google Account and have the Web & App Activity control enabled, you can obtain more relevant search results that are based on your previous searches and activity from other Google services
You can learn more here 
You may also get customised search results even when you’re signed out

For example, we analyse how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems
And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, such as Google Maps
If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer) and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (such as MAC address and signal strength)
All these things help to determine your location
You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services
Learn more As with other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data
Respect for the privacy and security of data that you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests
Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process
Find out more in our Transparency Report 
For example, we use cookies to analyse how people interact with our services
And that analysis can help us build better products
For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all
We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer
Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites
For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyse its traffic
Learn more There are over two million non-Google websites and apps that partner with Google to show ads
Learn more For example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, such as apps in the Play Store
We may also ask for other information, such as a business tax ID, to help process your payment
In some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this
We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect date of birth indicating that you’re not old enough to have a Google Account
Learn more You may also see personalised ads based on information from the advertiser
If you shopped on an advertiser’s website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads
Learn more If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings
For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you and make the ads you see more relevant to you
Learn more For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account)
For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s language models and build features like Google Translate
Or, if your business’ information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services
For example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser
Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected
Learn more Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include: Collecting and analysing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse
This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack
The 'last account activity' feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge
This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location and the date and time of access
Learn more When showing you personalised ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity
For example, you may see ads for things such as 'Cooking and Recipes' or 'Air Travel'
We don’t use topics or show personalised ads based on sensitive categories such as race, religion, sexual orientation or health
And we require the same from advertisers who use our services
Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement
For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel
For example, we operate data centres located around the world to help keep our products continuously available for users
Examples of these services include: Google Voice, for making and receiving calls, sending text messages and managing voicemail Google Meet, for making and receiving video calls Gmail, for sending and receiving emails Google Chat, for sending and receiving messages Google Duo, for making and receiving video calls and sending and receiving messages Google Fi, for a phone plan When lots of people start searching for something, it can provide useful information about particular trends at that time
Google Trends samples Google web searches to estimate the popularity of searches over a certain period of time and shares those results publicly in aggregated terms
Learn more For example, you can delete your blog from Blogger or a Google Site you own from Google Sites
You can also delete reviews that you’ve left on apps, games and other content in the Play Store
For example, we allow YouTube creators and advertisers to work with measurement companies to learn about the audience of their YouTube videos or ads, using cookies or similar technologies
Another example is merchants on our shopping pages, who use cookies to understand how many different people see their product listings
Learn more about these partners and how they use your information
Your Chrome browsing history is only saved to your account if you’ve enabled Chrome synchronisation with your Google Account
Learn more For example, when you type an address in the To, Cc or Bcc field of an email you’re composing, Gmail will suggest addresses based on the people you contact most frequently 
For example, we process your information to report usage statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services
We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so that we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely to have been seen by a viewer
We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant and Maps
When your device detects an audio activation command, like 'Hey Google', Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation
Learn more This activity might come from your use of Google services, for example from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google
Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services
For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube)
These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your account settings , and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information
