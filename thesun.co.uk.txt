Images of children are strictly regulated on our service
We allow them but must ensure that they comply with strict guidelines, including that they should not be sexualised in any way, and  that they are posted by the child’s immediate family
In many cases we find that parents or relatives upload pictures of their children in good faith, unaware that these might be copied and misused, or that there are privacy issues around their use on the internet
We remove them in the best interest of the child, and to protect the parents
Unfortunately, we can’t always tell for sure if a picture is that of a minor and, when in doubt, we’d rather err on the side of caution 
If you believe that your rights have been infringed in relation to your content or that your content posted by other users is in breach of these above rules, contact help@thesun.co.uk with details of the complaint and we will investigate

Banning users 
The Sun reserves the right to permanently ban any account at our own sole discretion
Users who are persistent in posting untolerated content within their comments, according to our judgement, may have their accounts banned
This means that a user will find they are unable to comment on the The Sun on any article across the website
Moderators may be forced to ban users as a result of the below actions: 
Posting content in breach of these Community Guidelines on the website – even if posted once 
Continuously attempting to re-post comments that have been previously moderated and deleted 
Posting continuous argumentative and/or off topic comments – The Sun encourages healthy debate but in a positive way (see Tips for Comments ) 
Posting comments that harass, threaten or attack anyone or otherwise behave in any way that would cause annoyance or distress to others 
Posting content that is repeatedly abusive towards The Sun’s moderation team – while we accept there may be criticism of our journalism, repeated personal attacks and abuse will not be tolerated 
Using offensive or inappropriate screen names 
Gaining unauthorised access to The Sun website, user accounts, computer system or networks connected to The Sun website 
Impersonating another person, whether a friend, family member, celebrity, moderator, another user of our services or an employee of any member of the News UK Group 
Registering or submitting content if you have been banned (for example with someone else’s account) without permission 
These rules are there to protect other users of The Sun and improve the community that we are so proud of
By virtue of this, we ask that you post responsibly without violating the above terms
You can help us maintain a positive and constructive conversation by flagging comments as set out below (see How to report a comment ) that you believe to be in violation or are offensive
These will be added to our moderation queue to review along with other comments picked by our system for potentially flouting our Community Guidelines
Tips for comments 
The Sun is invested in creating a valuable forum and a place for individuals to read and share their opinions
Below we have set out some suggestions as to how to write an effective comment that won’t be moderated: 
Stay on the main topic of discussion 
Avoid Caps Lock – it can look like you are shouting and sometimes have a negative impact on the way your comment is perceived 
Be open-minded about other people’s opinions and views – although you don’t have to agree with everyone, insulting or mocking their opinion is not acceptable 
Engage with other users appropriately – be respectful and polite to other users on the site 
Use the Like and Dislike features – this is a good way of communicating you agree or disagree without being argumentative 
Ask thoughtful questions 
Respond to Community Questions at the top of articles and Sun staff comments 
Double check your message before you post it – you will be allowed to edit it for a short amount of time 
In following these tips along with adhering to all of the Community Guidelines, it is very unlikely your comment will be moderated
How to report a comment 
If you see a comment that you think is a violation of the Community Guidelines, here are the steps to take in order to report it: 
See the ‘flag’ icon next to the comment you want to report 
Press it and you will be given the option to Report Post 
You will notice that the comment will temporarily disappear from view which means it has been delivered to The Sun’s moderation system to be checked
N.B The comment will still be visible to readers on the site unless it is later rejected by The Sun’s moderation team 
Reporting content that is genuinely hurtful/harmful/offensive is a positive action and we appreciate users who flag such comments
It is anonymous to other users and this information will be strictly confidential
However, reporting comments that are not legitimate violations can impact how efficiently we are able to remove the actual violations
Disagreement with someone’s views is not a reason to report them
Moderation 
When we receive your complaint, we will evaluate it and decide on the most suitable action
Rest assured that all complaints will be checked promptly and professionally
We may amend these Guidelines or any of our terms to ensure we remain compliant with relevant laws and regulations and that we are constantly improving your use of our services
