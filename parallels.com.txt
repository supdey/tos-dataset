You are not legally required to provide Parallels with the Personal Data described in this Privacy Statement
Further, the contractual relationship that you might have entered into with us by purchasing our Products does not imply any obligation to provide your Personal Data
However, you might not be able to use our Products to the full extent, or in some cases you may not be able to use our Products at all, if you do not provide us with certain data or object to the use of this data
When processing your Personal Data, we rely on the General Data Protection Regulation (" GDPR "), an EU-wide legal framework for the standardization of data protection
Parallels primarily processes data as a controller, for the purposes explained above under Sections 1 and 2 of this Privacy Statement
These purposes represent our legitimate interests for the purposes of Article 6 (1) f) GDPR

We use your data for " Profiling "

This also applies to the withdrawal of declarations of consent issued to us prior to the validity of the GDPR
In addition to the rights already mentioned, you have the right, for reasons arising from your particular situation, to object at any time to the processing of Personal Data relating to you, which is processed on the basis of Article 6 (1) e) GDPR (data processing in the public interest) and Article 6 (1) f) GDPR (data processing on the basis of a balance of interests); this also applies to profiling based on this provision within the meaning of Article 4 (4) GDPR
If you file an objection, we will no longer process your Personal Data unless we can prove compelling grounds for the processing that outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms or the processing serves to assert, exercise, or defend legal claims
Please also note that, if we terminate the processing due to your objection, the Sites or Products may no longer be available to you or only to a limited extent
You also have the right to object at any time to the processing of your Personal Data for the purpose of direct marketing, including any subscription to our newsletters or personalized ads; this also applies to Profiling, insofar as it is associated with such direct marketing
