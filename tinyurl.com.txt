Dispute Resolution
Any and all disputes, controversies, demands, counts, claims, or causes of action between you and TinyURL (including, but not limited to, disputes related in any way to the interpretation and scope of this clause, these Terms and our Privacy Policy , your use of the Site and Services, and the arbitrability of the dispute) shall exclusively be settled through binding and confidential arbitration.
THERE'S NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, PROCEDURES FOR ARBITRATION ARE SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED THAN RULES APPLICABLE IN COURT, AND REVIEW BY A COURT IS LIMITED.
Venue
Arbitration shall be subject to the U.S

YOU SPECIFICALLY AGREE THAT YOU ARE BOUND TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES IN ARBITRATION, AND YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU ARE VOLUNTARILY AND KNOWINGLY FORFEITING YOUR RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY AND TO OTHERWISE PROCEED IN A LAWSUIT IN STATE OR FEDERAL COURT.
Payment of arbitration costs will be governed by the AAA's fee schedule, unless you are able to show that your portion will be prohibitive as compared to litigation costs, in which case TinyURL will pay as much of your arbitration costs as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to litigation costs.
TinyURL also reserves the right, in its sole and exclusive discretion, to assume responsibility for all arbitration costs imposed by the AAA.
Each party agrees to pay its own attorneys' fees and expenses unless there is a governing statutory provision or remedy under the governing law that requires the prevailing party to be paid attorneys' fees and expenses.
Exceptions
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent the dispute arises from a violation of your or TinyURL's intellectual property rights in any manner, both parties agree that the non-infringing party may seek injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in a state or federal court consistent with the Governing Law and Jurisdiction subsections below, and both parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in such courts
Additionally, you or TinyURL may take the dispute to small claims court if the dispute qualifies for small claims court.
Waiver of Class Arbitration
To the fullest extent permissible under applicable law, all disputes shall be resolved by binding confidential arbitration on an individual basis
You expressly agree that no other disputes shall be consolidated or joined with your dispute, whether through class arbitration proceedings or otherwise
You further acknowledge and agree that any arbitrator assigned to a dispute shall not and lacks the authority to conduct class arbitration or award class-wide relief and that such arbitrator shall only hear your individual dispute
You acknowledge that you are voluntarily and knowingly waiving any right to participate as a representative of any class of claimants pertaining to any dispute subject to arbitration, such that you shall not be entitled to arbitrate any dispute as a representative plaintiff or claimant, class representative, class member, or private attorney general.
Governing Law
These Terms and all disputes between the parties shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of South Dakota, consistent with the U.S
Federal Arbitration Act, as they apply to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within South Dakota between South Dakota residents, without regard to any conflict-of-law provisions
Further, in any arbitration, both parties agree the arbitrator shall honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized under South Dakota law.
Enforcement of Arbitration Award
The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding on all parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
Severability
If any portion of this Dispute Resolution section (with the exception of the Waiver of Class Arbitration subsection) is deemed invalid or unenforceable by any arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction, the invalid or unenforceable portion shall be severed and removed from the Terms, and the remaining portions (including the Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes subsection) shall remain binding on you and TinyURL.
If any arbitrator deems the Waiver of Class Arbitration subsection to be invalid or unenforceable, then the entire Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes subsection shall be null and void
Under such circumstances, you expressly acknowledge and agree that the Governing Law and Jurisdiction subsections apply to any disputes between you and TinyURL, and both parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in such courts.
Jurisdiction
If, in any dispute, the Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes subsection above is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, notwithstanding the Severability subsection above, or null and void by any arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction, or if the dispute seeks injunctive remedies arising from a violation of your or TinyURL's intellectual property rights, the dispute shall be resolved by a court located in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.
The parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such South Dakota courts for the purposes of litigating any such dispute.
This subsection does not apply disputes made in small claims court.
Miscellaneous

They supersede any and all prior or contemporaneous agreements between you and TinyURL relating to your use of the Site or the Services.
If any part of these Terms is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, it will not impact any other provision of these Terms, all of which will remain in full force and effect.
The failure of TinyURL to partially or fully exercise any rights, or the waiver of TinyURL of any breach of these Terms by you, shall not prevent a subsequent exercise of such right by TinyURL or be deemed a waiver by TinyURL of any subsequent breach by you of the same or any other term of these Terms.
