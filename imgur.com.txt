Version 3.4 04/24/2019 
By uploading a file or other content or by making a comment, you represent and warrant to us that (1) doing so does not violate or infringe anyone else's rights; and (2) you created the file or other content you are uploading, or otherwise have sufficient intellectual property rights to upload the material consistent with these terms
With regard to any file or content you upload to the public portions of our site, you grant Imgur a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable worldwide license (with sublicense and assignment rights) to use, to display online and in any present or future media, to create derivative works of, to allow downloads of, and/or distribute any such file or content
To the extent that you delete any such file or content from the public portions of our site, the license you grant to Imgur pursuant to the preceding sentence will automatically terminate, but will not be revoked with respect to any file or content Imgur has already copied and sublicensed or designated for sublicense
Also, of course, anything you post to a public portion of our site may be used by the public pursuant to the following paragraph even after you delete it
By downloading an image or copying other user-generated content (UGC) from Imgur, you agree that you do not claim any rights to it
The following conditions apply: 
You may use UGC for personal, non-commercial purposes
You may use UGC for anything that qualifies as fair use under copyright law, for example journalism (news, comment, criticism, etc.), but please include an attribute ("Imgur" or "courtesy of Imgur") next to where it is displayed
You may not use UGC for non-journalistic commercial purposes
Your use of UGC is at your own risk
IMGUR MAKES NO WARRANTIES OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, and you will indemnify and hold Imgur harmless from any copyright infringement claims arising out of your use of the UGC
(See our general disclaimers below.) 
You may not copy or use any portions of our site that are not UGC except within the limits of fair use
If you see anything on our site that you believe infringes your copyright rights, you may notify our Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") agent by sending the following information: 
Identification of the copyrighted work or works claimed to have been infringed
IMPORTANT: please include your copyright registration number
If your work is not yet registered, please include a copy of the application to register the work that you filed with the Copyright Office
A copyright infringement claim based on a U.S
work can only be filed if the work has been registered ( http://www.copyright.gov/eco/ )
Registration currently takes about seven months
Identification of the material on our servers that is claimed to be infringing and that is to be removed, including the URL or other information to enable us to locate the material
A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by you as copyright owner, or by your agent, or by law
A statement that the information in your notice is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are the owner (or authorized to act on behalf of the owner) of the exclusive copyright right that is allegedly being infringed
Your physical or electronic signature, or of someone authorized to act on your behalf
Instructions on how we may contact you: preferably email, but also address and phone
Because a high percentage of DMCA takedown notices are not valid, Imgur reserves the right to ignore DMCA notifications based on unregistered works
Our agent to receive such notifications of claimed infringement is Alan Schaaf
Email: 
Mailing Address: 
Imgur Inc
268 Bush St

San Francisco, CA 94104 
Use the same procedure for any claimed trademark violations or other infringements
If we receive a DMCA takedown demand for material you posted that we believe constitutes fair use, we will attempt to notify you if we have your contact info; otherwise we are under no obligation to notify you regarding the removal
We reserve the right to refuse to remove any material that in our view constitutes fair use
If we identify you as a "repeat infringer," we will block or remove your images and terminate any accounts you have with us
(If we notify you of a DMCA removal and you respond with a legitimate counter-notice, that won't count toward being a repeat infringer.) Keep in mind that we reserve the right to remove any content at any time whether or not it infringes or violates any of our policies
Any uses of our name, trademarks, and logos must follow our
Trademark Use Policy .
