We built Xbox for people like you—for players from all walks of life, everywhere in the world, who all want the same thing: a place to play and have fun
We need your help keeping the Xbox community safe and fun for everyone
While the Code of Conduct section of the Microsoft Services Agreement applies to all Microsoft products, Xbox offers so many ways to interact with others that it benefits from an additional level of explanation
To this end, we’ve created the following community standards for Xbox
Consider these standards a roadmap for contributing to this incredible, globe-spanning community
Remember: the Xbox community is yours
We all bring something unique, and that uniqueness is worth protecting
Whether you’re brand new to gaming or have been playing for decades, we need you to be stewards of this place, to protect each other even as you compete
Because when everyone plays, we all win
The spirit of Xbox lives in our values, which are key to sustaining a vibrant and welcoming community
Living these values every time we play shows the world the unifying power of gaming
Gaming can be enjoyed by all 
Creativity powers community 
Competition is best when it’s fair 
Helping others makes all of us stronger 
Hate has no place here 
Some parts of the internet don’t have rules—and the Xbox community isn’t one of them
Yes, Xbox is, in a meaningful sense, your gaming network
But it belongs to millions of others, too
You deserve a place to be yourself with confidence, free from bullying, hatred and harassment—and so does every other player
So it’s important to treat others as they would like to be treated
Remember: 
Win or lose, be a good sport 
Did someone have a great game? Let them know! 
You are the community 
A little bit of trash talk is okay, but keep it clean 
No one likes trolling, so don’t do it 
The gamertags, gamerpics, screenshots, game clips and other posts you make with Xbox can be a great way to show off what’s meaningful to you
We encourage all players to be themselves and show off what they like, what makes them laugh, or what makes them amazing
But this sharing can’t come at the expense of other players’ positive experiences
Remember: 
Use your skills and creativity to add informative, helpful, funny or interesting content that contributes positively to our vibrant and diverse community 
Content you post needs to suit a wide audience 
Context is important, and mature content that makes sense in a game might not be appropriate elsewhere in the Xbox community 
Not everyone has the same likes or dislikes as you, so think twice about saying something hurtful about someone else’s content, playing style or choices 
Helping others makes us all stronger 
If you want to be a superstar and live our shared values, here are ways to go the extra mile: 
Help others have great gaming experiences by joining the Xbox Ambassadors 
Know a great community leader? Nominate them for the Xbox MVP Award 
Hang with likeminded players by joining clubs 
Make new friends by creating Looking for Groups to team with others in your favourite game 
If you experience or witness inappropriate content or behaviour, we encourage you to mute, block and report the player(s) acting inappropriately 
At Xbox, PlayStation and Nintendo, we believe video games are a unifying force for the world
Cross-platform play empowers players across platforms to take part in a connected community that spans the globe, and no matter where you play we welcome you to join
As we come together, remember we’re all gamers, and we all have a role in helping others level up: 
Remember: 
Be a positive ambassador for your platform 
Welcome all players to foster healthy cross-platform competition 
Passion for your platform is great, but respect where others play 
Be considerate
Every player is here to have fun! 
If you've seen the Microsoft Services Agreement , the following rules probably look familiar
They may sound a bit like legalese , but bear with us—upholding these standards is critical to maintaining a community where everyone can have fun! People differ about what seems fun, and conflicts sometimes occur
But while plenty of conflicts can be worked out between players, there are nevertheless some things we just can’t tolerate
In each section you’ll find examples showing how the Microsoft Services Agreement’s Code of Conduct relates to Xbox
Xbox is available in countries all over the world, and it’s important that people of all backgrounds feel safe and comfortable on our platform
To help ensure this, we must respect local laws and remove content or behaviour that advocates or promotes illegal activities
For example, don’t: 
Build a club around illegal drug use 
Send messages that encourage under-age drinking 
Create activity feed posts that promote criminal gangs 
Upload custom gamerpics that show animal abuse 
Tell other players to “KYS” or commit self-harm 
Use the flag of a terrorist organisation as your club’s profile pic 
To keep Xbox a place where everyone can have fun, we can’t allow behaviour or content designed to exploit, harm or threaten anyone – children, adults, or otherwise
When threatening, abusive or insulting language is used against another member of our community, or the community at large, it undermines every player’s ability to enjoy themselves
For example, don’t: 
Threaten someone with physical assault after an intense game 
Message other players with homophobic slurs 
Make a club grounded in ethnic hatred 
Create a Looking for Group that negatively calls out another player 
Post insults in another player’s activity feed 
Respond to someone’s smack talk with sexual slurs 
It’s great to be excited about growing your popularity and sharing all the cool things you do with Xbox
The best way to do that is by producing amazing content—not through give-aways, asking for likes and followers, or other inauthentic behaviour
The best way to gain a following is by being yourself and creating awesome content that’s uniquely yours
Remember, creativity powers community 
For example, don’t: 
Regularly offer prizes in exchange for follows 
Use frequent give-aways to increase likes on activity feed posts 
Ask or demand that someone “add” or “follow” you or another player 
Repetitively message other players without their consent 
Repeatedly share the same screenshot in clubs 
Send repeated game invites to players who haven’t shown an interest in joining 
People enjoy all shapes and styles of content with Xbox
Everyone’s tastes are different, and that’s great! However, that doesn’t mean that absolutely anything goes
To keep the Xbox community welcoming and inclusive for everyone, some content must be avoided
Support a welcoming and inclusive community 
Harassment and hate take many forms, but none have a home here
To make the Xbox community a place where everyone can hang out, and to prevent people from feeling uncomfortable or unwelcome, we all need to be stewards
This means more than just not harassing other players—it means embracing them
It means saving those unsavoury jokes for people you know will enjoy them
It means taking particular care for others while you play, keeping in mind how they might interpret your content
For example, don’t: 
Make fun of other people’s identities or personal traits 
Send harassing or abusive messages 
Use a club to shame other players or groups 
Start a broadcast in order to troll someone 
Flood voice chat with music during a multiplayer match 
Post game clips that will offend many others 
Know the difference between trash talk and harassment 
We get it—gaming can be competitive and interactions with other players can get heated
A little trash talk is an expected part of competitive multiplayer action, and that’s not a bad thing
But hate has no place here , and what’s not okay is when that trash talk turns into harassment
Trash talk includes any lighthearted banter or bragging that focuses on the game at hand and encourages healthy competition
Harassment includes any negative behaviour that’s personalised, disruptive, or likely to make someone feel unwelcome or unsafe
To qualify as harassment, the behaviour doesn’t have to be drawn-out or persistent
Even a single abusive message could harm someone’s experience
Know when to draw the line, when to back off
Know and respect the other player.
For example: 
Acceptable trash talk includes 
Get destroyed
Can’t believe you thought you were on my level
That was some serious potato aim
Get wrecked
Only reason you went positive was you spent all game camping
Try again, kid
Cheap win
Come at me when you can actually drive without running cars off the road
That sucked
Get good and then come back when your k/d’s over 1
Going too far looks like 
Get <sexual threat>
Can’t believe you thought you were on my level
Hey <profanity>, that was some serious potato aim
Get wrecked, trash
Only reason you went positive was you spent all game camping
KYS, kid
Cheap win
Totally expected from a <racial slur>
You suck
Get out of my country—maybe they’ll let you back in when your k/d’s over 1
Be yourself, but not at the expense of others 
The Xbox community is yours, but it’s everyone else’s too
We encourage showing off what makes you unique and awesome, but it’s not cool to post something that keeps others from having positive experiences
We aspire to a community where gaming can be enjoyed by all 
Problematic content just gets in the way
If you’re looking for a place on the internet to be overly edgy or get that rise out of people, Xbox isn’t the place for you
For example, don’t: 
Upload a gamerpic that shows real-life graphic violence 
Make provocative religious comments in your profile 
Name a club after a highly controversial figure 
Send someone a picture that’s meant to shock or disgust 
Use your activity feed as a platform to promote controversial politics 
Upload a club profile pic that’s similar to imagery used by hate groups 
Make stuff that’s suitable for all audiences 
People from all over the world play with Xbox, and we understand that people from different backgrounds have diverse perspectives about mature and adult topics
But because the Xbox community must be friendly and accessible to everyone, this isn't the appropriate place for sexual content
Keep your posts and messages suitable for all audiences to help keep this a welcoming place for all
For example, don’t: 
Upload screenshots or game clips that include mature sexual content 
Use a custom gamerpic that contains nudity 
Send lewd messages to other players 
Share pictures that may be considered distasteful or inappropriate 
They’ll see what you did there 
Sometimes something seemingly harmless can actually reference something inappropriate, when looked at a certain way
Everyone appreciates a good joke, but if your content is designed to trick others into thinking they’re reading or seeing something inappropriate, we’ll have to treat it that way
For example, don’t: 
Frame a custom gamerpic to make it look like something inappropriate 
Choose a gamertag that includes an inappropriate play on words 
Use double entendres or phrases with inappropriate dual meanings in your profile 
Fraud is any attempt to use deceit or misrepresentation for personal or financial gain
When players commit fraud against Xbox, it circumvents the processes that keep things fair for everyone, and ends up making games, add-ons and subscriptions more expensive for everyone
This also applies to trying to make money through Xbox in unapproved ways, since doing so bypasses safeguards that exist to help keep everyone safe and financially secure
For example, don’t: 
Give another person access to your Microsoft account 
Sell or attempt to sell your gamertag or account to someone else 
Sell in-game content outside of official in-game mechanisms and stores 
Trade game lessons for Xbox gift cards or other compensation 
Buy a game from an unauthorised seller 
Share ways to fraudulently get Xbox Live Gold subscription codes for free 
Try to get out-of-policy refunds or compensation from Xbox support 
Give other players the impression that you’re a Microsoft employee 
Pretend to be an employee of a game developer 
Intentionally represent yourself as a player other than yourself to cause drama 
Charge another player to help them complete a level in a game 
It’s never fun to lose access to Xbox features, but know that when we put restrictions in place, we do so to help ensure everyone’s safety or improve an experience for the community
Attempting to circumvent restrictions can affect both customer privacy and the integrity of Microsoft or partner services
For the safety of all, it’s important to respect deliberate limitations
For example, don’t: 
Create alternate Microsoft accounts to circumvent a suspension or restriction 
Use other accounts to continue communicating with a player who blocked you 
Try to circumvent regional content restrictions 
Resell or redistribute any part of Xbox services 
Cheating, tampering and the use of exploits 
Since competition is best when it’s fair , a level playing field is one of the most important requirements for gaming
When people cheat, use exploits, or otherwise tamper with hardware or software to gain a competitive advantage, it ruins the experience for everyone
Because of this, cheating, tampering and the use of exploits is never acceptable in the Xbox community
Like, never
For example, don’t: 
Use “mods” in games that do not allow modded content 
Use a glitch that lets you use your character outside of a multiplayer map 
Use specialised software to gain unfair advantage over other players 
Use Xbox services with modified or tampered hardware 
Manipulate game stats to gain a competitive advantage against other players 
Use multiple profiles to unfairly manipulate your multiplayer rank 
Try to circumvent in-game economies through “money drop lobbies” 
Use unauthorised hardware or accessories 
Use exploits to “duplicate” in-game items 
Intentionally play with or support someone who uses harmful or inappropriate mods 
Intentionally “teamkill” other players 
Piracy and unauthorised use 
Pirating software is not a victimless crime—it robs game providers of revenue that funds games and add-ons that people want to play
Accessing or using content in inappropriate ways can contribute to fraud and spoil great experiences for other players, sapping the magic of Xbox
By using games and game content only in the ways intended, you help maintain a vibrant community for content creators and fellow players alike
For example, don’t: 
Play a pirated game 
Play a game before its release date 
Share your profile with another person 
Try to access accounts you don’t own 
Use someone’s intellectual property in a way that’s not permitted 
Share content covered under a non-disclosure agreement that you’ve signed 
Damaging Microsoft, Xbox, or its customers 
Manipulation, exploitation and abuse of Xbox services doesn’t just affect Microsoft
These actions also inhibit the ability of Microsoft to provide the best possible services to customers around the world
At Xbox, we’re dedicated to the safety and well-being of our community, and we’re committed to ensuring that the products, features and services our customers enjoy are safe, secure and fun for everyone
For example, don’t: 
Share tutorials showing how to financially exploit Xbox 
Share links to malware 
Interfere with someone’s ability to access their network or device 
Take any part in DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks 
Share confidential content during a game’s alpha or beta test 
Abuse Microsoft or Xbox staff (verbally or in text) 
Try to reverse-engineer or manipulate Xbox services 
Encourage terrorism (as by posting instructions for making bombs or other weapons) 
Essentially, this means don’t use things that don’t belong to you and don’t do things you don’t have permission to do 
People work hard to make screen shots, game clips and other content that’s enjoyed by millions of people
It’s important to let content creators unveil and share what they create on their terms
If you’re not sure if it’s okay to use something, it’s better to be safe and assume that using someone’s content is not okay
For example, don’t: 
Use someone’s intellectual property in an unauthorised way 
Access or try to access profiles you don’t own 
Use copyrighted logos or other material that you don’t have permission to use 
Disclose the surprise ending to a new game 
Leak game content before an important announcement 
Microsoft runs on trust , and it’s critical that we protect the privacy of our customers
We take this responsibility seriously, and we won’t tolerate behaviour or content that puts the privacy or security of another player at risk
For example, don’t: 
Share your profile with someone else 
Use someone else’s credit cards without their permission 
Share information about another player more broadly than they’ve agreed to 
Post private information about another player (engage in doxing) 
Use someone else’s profile to buy things for yourself 
Sometimes, helping others break rules is just as harmful as breaking rules yourself
If you know that someone is engaging in behaviour or dispersing content that violates these community standards, let them know that their behaviour is not okay, and caution them rather than help them walk the road they’re on
For example, don’t: 
Create clubs to help people get harmful or inappropriate mods from other players 
Make Looking for Groups announcing that players have profiles for sale 
Participate in communities focused on cheating and fraudulent exploits 
Share links to websites that promote activities that break the rules 
Co-host or route players to a modded multiplayer lobby that provides an unfair gameplay advantage 
Our priority is the safety of everyone in the Xbox community
Content and behaviour that puts players at risk or makes them feel unwelcome has no place here
So, sometimes we need to step in
We're not out to punish, but rather to protect everyone's experience
Every suspension or other corrective action aims only to show what was wrong and what can be learned from a situation
When suspensions end, we welcome players back so they can contribute to the Xbox community in positive ways
We know people make mistakes, and we believe lapses in judgement can be significant opportunities for growth
Inappropriate conduct 
If you violate Xbox community standards, you may find restrictions placed on your profile and/or device
When we suspend an Xbox profile, we restrict access to features that are most closely associated with the problematic behaviour
Most commonly, this means a temporary suspension that removes one or more features for a period of time
Temporary suspensions can include: 
Restrictions on the use of online multiplayer gaming 
Removal of the ability to send text and voice messages 
Blocking real-time voice and text communications 
Preventing the broadcast of live game play 
Restrictions on the use of parties and clubs 
Inappropriate content 
Since Xbox content must be appropriate for all audiences, sometimes we remove content to protect our customers
Depending on the type of content violation, this can result in us restricting certain features for the profile that created or shared the content
Temporary suspensions can include: 
Blocks on the ability to upload game clips and screenshots 
Restrictions on uploading or sharing Kinect content 
Removal of inappropriate content from Xbox 
Automatic assignment of a new gamertag 
Limits on the ability to share Xbox content on other social networks 
Removal of the ability to edit your Xbox profile or clubs 
Repeat or severe offences 
We may permanently suspend a profile or device if we can no longer trust it due to a severe violation, or if our attempts to correct repeated negative behaviours are unsuccessful
Under permanent suspension, the owner of the suspended profile forfeits all licences for games and other content, Xbox Live Gold and Xbox Game Pass membership time, and Microsoft account balances
