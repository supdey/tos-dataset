Registered persons have the right to change or request the complete deletion of personal data provided during registration, if this is not inconsistent with any legal regulations
On request, we will provide any data subject with information regarding what personal data we have saved in relation to them
Furthermore, we will correct or delete personal data on request or if instructed by the data subject, to the extent that this is not inconsistent with a statutory data retention obligation

Newsletters 
a) Subscription to our newsletter 
On our website, users are given the opportunity to subscribe to our enterprise's newsletter
The input mask used for this purpose determines what personal data are transmitted, as well as when the newsletter is ordered from the controller
We inform our customers and business partners regularly by means of a newsletter about enterprise offers
The enterprise's newsletter may only be received by the data subject if the data subject has a valid e-mail address and the data subject registers for the newsletter shipping
A confirmation e-mail will be sent to the e-mail address registered by a data subject for the first time for newsletter shipping, for legal reasons, in the double opt-in procedure
This confirmation e-mail is used to prove whether the owner of the e-mail address as the data subject is authorized to receive the newsletter
During the registration for the newsletter, we also store the IP address of the computer system assigned by the Internet service provider (ISP) and used by the data subject at the time of the registration, as well as the date and time of the registration
The collection of this data is necessary in order to understand the (possible) misuse of the e-mail address of a data subject at a later date, and it therefore serves the aim of the legal protection of the controller
The personal data collected as part of a registration for the newsletter will only be used to send our newsletter
In addition, subscribers to the newsletter may be informed by e-mail, if this is necessary for the operation of the newsletter service or a registration in question, as this could be the case in the event of modifications to the newsletter offer, or in the event of a change in technical 
Our newsletters are sent using the service provider Oracle Deutschland B.V
& Co
KG, Riesstraße 25, 80992 München, Germany
The servers are located in the Netherlands (Laarderhoogtweg 57, 1101 EB, Amsterdam)
In the context of support and administration services, it cannot be ruled out in individual cases that individual employees of Oracle Corporation outside the EU may also have access to user data as part of their contractual performance of services
As a precautionary measure, we have ensured an appropriate level of data protection at Oracle Corporation by means of sufficient guarantees within the meaning of the GDPR
The data that is entered during registration is not sent to other third parties 
You can find additional information regarding Oracle Deutschland B.V

a) of the GDPR)
You may withdraw this consent at any time
There are no formal requirements for this; a simple email to us will suffice
Withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of any data processing which has occurred prior to the withdrawal of consent
b) Newsletter-Tracking 
Our newsletter contains so-called tracking pixels
A tracking pixel is a miniature graphic embedded in such e-mails, which are sent in HTML format to enable log file recording and analysis
This allows a statistical analysis of the success or failure of online marketing campaigns
Based on the embedded tracking pixel, we may see if and when an e-mail was opened by a data subject, and which links in the e-mail were called up by data subjects
Such personal data collected in the tracking pixels contained in the newsletters are stored and analyzed by us in order to optimize the shipping of the newsletter, as well as to adapt the content of future newsletters even better to the interests of the data subject
These personal data will not be passed on to third parties
Data subjects are at any time entitled to revoke the respective separate declaration of consent issued by means of the double-opt-in procedure
After a revocation, these personal data will be deleted by us
We automatically regard a withdrawal from the receipt of the newsletter as a revocation

Information that we automatically receive based on your use of Sedo 
When you use our services or visit our website, we automatically collect data regarding your use or your visit
We do this using various tracking technologies
On the one hand, we collect user and third-party data on our server
On the other, we use cookies, pixels and similar tracking technologies on devices
a) Data protection provisions about the application and use of Google analytics (with anonymization function) 
On our website we have integrated the component of Google Analytics (with the anonymizer function)
Google Analytics is a web analytics service
Web analytics is the collection, gathering, and analysis of data about the behavior of visitors to websites
A web analysis service collects, inter alia, data about the website from which a person has come (the so-called referrer), which sub-pages were visited, or how often and for what duration a sub-page was viewed
Web analytics are mainly used for the optimization of a website and in order to carry out a cost-benefit analysis of Internet advertising
The operator of the Google Analytics component is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, United States
For the web analytics through Google Analytics we use the application "_gat
_anonymizeIp"
By means of this application the IP address of the Internet connection of the data subject is abridged by Google and anonymised when accessing our websites from a Member State of the European Union or another Contracting State to the Agreement on the European Economic Area
The purpose of the Google Analytics component is to analyze the traffic on our website
Google uses the collected data and information, inter alia, to evaluate the use of our website and to provide online reports, which show the activities on our websites, and to provide other services concerning the use of our Internet site for us
Google Analytics places a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject
The definition of cookies is explained above
With the setting of the cookie, Google is enabled to analyze the use of our website
With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet site, which is operated by us and into which a Google Analytics component was integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject will automatically submit data through the Google Analytics component for the purpose of online advertising and the settlement of commissions to Google
During the course of this technical procedure, the enterprise Google gains knowledge of personal information, such as the IP address of the data subject, which serves Google, inter alia, to understand the origin of visitors and clicks, and subsequently create commission settlements
The cookie is used to store personal information, such as the access time, the location from which the access was made, and the frequency of visits of our website by the data subject
With each visit to our Internet site, such personal data, including the IP address of the Internet access used by the data subject, will be transmitted to Google in the United States of America
These personal data are stored by Google in the United States of America
Google may pass these personal data collected through the technical procedure to third parties
The data subject may, as stated above, prevent the setting of cookies through our website at any time by means of a corresponding adjustment of the web browser used and thus permanently deny the setting of cookies
Such an adjustment to the Internet browser used would also prevent Google Analytics from setting a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject
In addition, cookies already in use by Google Analytics may be deleted at any time via a web browser or other software programs
In addition, the data subject has the possibility of objecting to a collection of data that are generated by Google Analytics, which is related to the use of this website, as well as the processing of this data by Google and the chance to preclude any such
For this purpose, the data subject must download a browser add-on under the link tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout and install it
This browser add-on tells Google Analytics through a JavaScript, that any data and information about the visits of Internet pages may not be transmitted to Google Analytics
The installation of the browser add-ons is considered an objection by Google
If the information technology system of the data subject is later deleted, formatted, or newly installed, then the data subject must reinstall the browser add-ons to disable Google Analytics
If the browser add-on was uninstalled by the data subject or any other person who is attributable to their sphere of competence, or is disabled, it is possible to execute the reinstallation or reactivation of the browser add-ons
Further information and the applicable data protection provisions of Google may be retrieved under www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/ and under www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html 
Google Analytics is further explained under the following Link www.google.com/analytics/

b) Data protection provisions about the application and use of Google Remarketing 
As a further tracking-technology we have integrated Google Remarketing services on our website
Google Remarketing is a feature of Google AdWords, which allows an enterprise to display advertising to Internet users who have previously resided on the enterprise's Internet site
The integration of Google Remarketing therefore allows an enterprise to create user-based advertising and thus shows relevant advertisements to interested Internet users
The operating company of the Google Remarketing services is the Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, United States
The purpose of Google Remarketing is the insertion of interest-relevant advertising
Google Remarketing allows us to display ads on the Google network or on other websites, which are based on individual needs and matched to the interests of Internet users
Google Remarketing sets a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject
The definition of cookies is explained above
With the setting of the cookie, Google enables a recognition of the visitor of our website if he calls up consecutive web pages, which are also a member of the Google advertising network
With each call-up to an Internet site on which the service has been integrated by Google Remarketing, the web browser of the data subject identifies automatically with Google
During the course of this technical procedure, Google receives personal information, such as the IP address or the surfing behavior of the user, which Google uses, inter alia, for the insertion of interest relevant advertising
The cookie is used to store personal information, e.g
the Internet pages visited by the data subject
Each time we visit our Internet pages, personal data, including the IP address of the Internet access used by the data subject, is transmitted to Google in the United States of America
These personal data are stored by Google in the United States of America
Google may pass these personal data collected through the technical procedure to third parties
The data subject may, as stated above, prevent the setting of cookies through our website at any time by means of a corresponding adjustment of the web browser used and thus permanently deny the setting of cookies
Such an adjustment to the Internet browser used would also prevent Google from setting a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject
In addition, cookies already in use by Google may be deleted at any time via a web browser or other software programs
In addition, the data subject has the possibility of objecting to the interest-based advertising by Google
For this purpose, the data subject must call up the link to www.google.de/settings/ads and make the desired settings on each Internet browser used by the data subject
Further information and the actual data protection provisions of Google may be retrieved under www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/

f) Data protection provisions about the application and use of Facebook 
On our website we have integrated components of the enterprise Facebook
Facebook is a social network
A social network is a place for social meetings on the Internet, an online community, which usually allows users to communicate with each other and interact in a virtual space
A social network may serve as a platform for the exchange of opinions and experiences, or enable the Internet community to provide personal or business-related information
Facebook allows social network users to include the creation of private profiles, upload photos, and network through friend requests
The operating company of Facebook is Facebook, Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, United States
If a person lives outside of the United States or Canada, the controller is the Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland
With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet website, which is operated by us and into which a Facebook component (Facebook plug-ins) was integrated, the web browser on the information technology system of the data subject is automatically prompted to download display of the corresponding Facebook component from Facebook through the Facebook component
An overview of all the Facebook Plug-ins may be accessed under developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/ 
During the course of this technical procedure, Facebook is made aware of what specific sub-site of our website was visited by the data subject
If the data subject is logged in at the same time on Facebook, Facebook detects with every call-up to our website by the data subject—and for the entire duration of their stay on our Internet site—which specific sub-site of our Internet page was visited by the data subject
This information is collected through the Facebook component and associated with the respective Facebook account of the data subject
If the data subject clicks on one of the Facebook buttons integrated into our website, e.g
the "Like" button, or if the data subject submits a comment, then Facebook matches this information with the personal Facebook user account of the data subject and stores the personal data
Facebook always receives, through the Facebook component, information about a visit to our website by the data subject, whenever the data subject is logged in at the same time on Facebook during the time of the call-up to our website
This occurs regardless of whether the data subject clicks on the Facebook component or not
If such a transmission of information to Facebook is not desirable for the data subject, then he or she may prevent this by logging off from their Facebook account before a call-up to our website is made
The data protection guideline published by Facebook, which is available at facebook.com/about/privacy/ , provides information about the collection, processing and use of personal data by Facebook
In addition, it is explained there what setting options Facebook offers to protect the privacy of the data subject
In addition, different configuration options are made available to allow the elimination of data transmission to Facebook
These applications may be used by the data subject to eliminate a data transmission to Facebook

On our Sites, we use Content Delivery Network (CDN) from Akamai Technologies GmbH, Parkring 20-22, 85748 Garching, Germany, and (collectively, "Akamai") as a processor for the purpose of service delivery of the CDN solution
CacheNetworks, LLC, 111 W
Jackson Blvd
Suite 160, Chicago, Illinois 60604, USA ("Cachefly")
For the purpose of a shorter loading time of our online presence, we use a so-called Content Delivery Network ("CDN"), in which the website is delivered via web servers of CacheflyAkamai, which acts for us in the context of an order processing
With the CDN, content from our website such as images, fonts, stylesheets and scripts are thus delivered to you more quickly via a network of distributed servers
For this purpose, the browser you use must connect to Cachefly Akamai's servers
In this way, Cachefly Akamai learns that our website has been accessed via your IP address, together with all the information that your browser discloses in the request
The resulting data is only used for the aforementioned purpose and to maintain the functionality and security of the CDN
The service provider uses Akamai International B.V., Coengebouw Building Kabelweg 37, 7th floor, 1014 BA Amsterdam, Netherlands and Akamai Technologies, Inc., 150 Broadway, Cambridge, 02142 MA, USA to provide the service
The appropriate level of data protection is ensured by the conclusion of a contract processing agreement, provided that the data is processed within the EU and EEA
The transfer to Akamai Technologies, Inc
takes place in the USA and thus in a state outside the EU or EEA
Here, the appropriate level of data protection is ensured by concluding a contract that complies with the standard contractual clauses of the European Commission
This transfer is permitted under Article 45 of the GDPR, as Akamai Technologies, Inc is Privacy Shield certified and thus an adequate level of data protection exists under the Commission's Implementing Decision (EU) 2016/1250 ( https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016D1250&from=DE )

j) Cloudflare 
We use Cloudflare from Cloudflare, Inc, 101 Townsend St., San Francisco, CA 94107, USA on this website
Cloudflare helps us to make our website more secure
For this, Cloudflare provides us with security services, such as DDoS protection and web firewall
Cloudflare blocks threats and limits abusive bots and crawlers that waste our bandwidth and server resources
By storing our website on local data centers and blocking spam software, Cloudflare allows us to reduce our bandwidth usage
Serving content through a data center near you and some web optimizations performed there reduces the average website load time by about half
Cloudflare generally forwards only that data which is controlled by website operators
Thus, the content is not determined by Cloudflare, but always by the website operator itself
In addition, Cloudflare may collect certain information about the use of our website and process data that is sent by us or for which Cloudflare has received appropriate instructions
In most cases, Cloudflare receives data such as contact information, IP addresses, security fingerprints, DNS log data, and performance data for websites derived from browser activity
Log data helps Cloudflare detect new threats, for example
This allows Cloudflare to ensure a high level of security protection for our website
Cloudflare processes this data as part of the services in compliance with applicable laws
This of course includes the German Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
For security reasons, Cloudflare also uses a cookie
The cookie is used to identify individual users behind a shared IP address and to apply security settings for each individual user
For example, this cookie becomes very useful when you use our website from a location where there are a number of infected computers
However, if your computer is trustworthy, we can recognize this from the cookie
Thus, despite infected PCs in the vicinity, you can surf our website unhindered
It is also important to know that this cookie does not store any personal data
This cookie is absolutely necessary for the Cloudflare security features and cannot be disabled

Sometimes it may be necessary to conclude a contract that the data subject provides us with personal data, which must subsequently be processed by us
The data subject is, for example, obliged to provide us with personal data when our company signs a contract with him or her
The non-provision of the personal data would have the consequence that the contract with the data subject could not be concluded
Before personal data is provided by the data subject, the data subject must contact any employee
