Dispute Resolution 
MANDATORY ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER - PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY - IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS AND GOVERNS HOW YOU AND GAMESTOP CAN BRING CLAIMS AGAINST EACH OTHER
 THIS SECTION WILL, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION, REQUIRE YOU AND GAMESTOP TO SUBMIT CLAIMS AGAINST EACH OTHER TO BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS
 THIS MEANS THAT YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BRING A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE LAWSUIT IN A COURT OF LAW BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY OR TO APPEAL DECISIONS CONCERNING ANY DISPUTE THAT MAY ARISE WHICH IS COVERED BY THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND ARE INSTEAD AGREEING TO SUBMIT ANY SUCH DISPUTE SOLELY ON YOUR OWN BEHALF TO AN IMPARTIAL ARBITRATOR
INFORMAL RESOLUTION: You and GameStop will first attempt to resolve any claim informally
 Accordingly, neither you nor GameStop may start a formal arbitration proceeding for at least 60 days after one party notifies the other party of a claim in writing
 As part of this informal resolution process, You must deliver Your written notices via hand or first-class mail to us at GameStop, Attn: Guest Care, 625 Westport Parkway Grapevine, Texas 76051
GOVERNING LAW: You and GameStop agree that these Terms and any Dispute you may have with GameStop, will be governed by federal law and the Federal Arbitration Act as to arbitration issues and the law of the State of Texas for all other issues, without reference to the principles of conflicts of laws thereof
You agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (1980) and Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA), as adopted by any state, are specifically excluded from application to this Agreement
WE BOTH AGREE TO ARBITRATE:  You and GameStop agree to resolve any dispute between you and GameStop or its affiliates (“Dispute”) through final and binding arbitration, with two exceptions
 First to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate our intellectual property rights (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) or to the extent that you believe we have violated or threatened to violate your intellectual property rights
 Under such circumstances we or you may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above
  Second, you may bring any matter within the jurisdiction of a small claims court or similar court in which you seek less than $10,000 in a small claims court or similar court on an individual basis without a class action and without any request for injunctive relief
WHAT IS ARBITRATION: You and GameStop mutually agree to forego the delay and expense of using a court of law and choose instead to benefit from the speedy, economical, and impartial dispute resolution procedure of using binding arbitration for Disputes that arise between You and GameStop, its related and affiliated companies, successors, and assigns; and/or any current or former employee, officer, or director of GameStop or any related or affiliated company
 Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court and seeks to resolve disputes more quickly
Instead of a judge or a jury, the case will be decided by a neutral arbitrator who has the power to award the same damages and relief that a court can
 If any provision of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision shall be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms shall be enforced
You and GameStop agree that this Dispute Resolution Section is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C
§ 1 et seq., and will survive even if these Terms and Conditions terminate
 Any revision to or termination of the Terms & Conditions that modify or terminate this Dispute Resolution Section shall not apply to a pending arbitration, to any claim that accrued prior to the modification or termination, or to any claim that the asserting party knew about prior to the modification or termination, except as may be required by applicable law
WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL: THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration
Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court
 In the event any litigation should arise between You and us in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND GAMESTOP WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT YOU MAY CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY IN DECIDING TO ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE
NO CLASS ACTIONS: Except as otherwise required under applicable law, You and GameStop agree to arbitrate any Dispute only on an individual basis and hereby waive any right to bring, participate in, or receive money or any other relief from any representative, class, consolidated, or collective proceeding  (“Class Action Waiver”)
  No party may bring a claim on behalf of other individuals, and no arbitrator hearing any claim under these Terms and Conditions may: (a) without the consent of all parties, combine more than one individual’s claim or claims into a single case; (b) order, require, participate in, or facilitate production of class-wide contact information or notification of others of potential claims; or (c) arbitrate any form of a class, collective, consolidated, representative, or private attorney general proceeding
WHO DECIDES WHAT CAN BE ARBITRATED: If a party violates the agreement to arbitrate by commencing an action asserting a Dispute in a court of law, then the court (and not an arbitrator) shall have the authority to resolve any disputes about the interpretation, formation, existence, enforceability, validity, and scope of this Dispute Resolution Section
 If a party complies with the agreement to arbitrate and files for arbitration without filing a complaint in a court of law, then the arbitrator shall have the authority to resolve any disputes about the interpretation of this Dispute Resolution Section for purposes of discovery or the merits of the underlying claim, but shall have no authority to resolve any disputes about the formation, existence, enforceability, or validity of this Dispute Resolution Section, including the Class Action Waiver
WHAT ARE THE ARBITRATION RULES, PROCEDURES, AND COSTS: To initiate arbitration, the party desiring to pursue a legal dispute must prepare a written demand setting forth the claim(s) and deliver the written demand within the applicable statute of limitations period by hand or first-class mail to JAMS Mediation, Arbitration and ADR Services (“JAMS”) and us at GameStop, Attn: General Counsel, 625 Westport Parkway Grapevine, Texas 76051
You and GameStop agree that the arbitration shall be administered by JAMS before a single arbitrator mutually agreed upon by the parties
 Except to the extent that they are modified by the rules below, if You are an individual person, the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules & Procedures that are in effect at the time of the filing of the demand (and that are available at https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/) will apply
The parties agree that the applicable JAMS rules are modified as follows: 
(a)          Any arbitrator must be neutral as to all parties
 Standards for the recusal of an arbitrator shall be the same standards under which trial judges are recused under Texas law
 Unless you prefer otherwise and GameStop agrees, the arbitration shall be conducted in the county in which you reside
 Or if that is not practicable, in an adjacent county as determined by JAMS
(b)          No party is entitled to its attorneys’ fees, except as may be awarded in a matter authorized by and consistent with applicable law
(c)           All discovery shall be subject to any and all objections available under FRCP 26(b)
 Each party shall avoid broad or widespread collection, search, and production of documents, including electronically stored information
 If a compelling need is demonstrated by the requesting party, the production shall: (i) be narrowly tailored in scope; (ii) only come from sources that are reasonably accessible without undue burden or cost; and (iii) be produced in a searchable format, if possible without undue burden or cost, and which is usable by the receiving party and convenient and economical for the producing party
 Where the costs and burdens of the requested discovery outweigh its likely benefit, considering the needs of the case, the amount in controversy, and the importance of the discovery in resolving the issues, the arbitrator shall deny such requests or order production on condition that the requesting party advance to the producing party the reasonable costs involved in making the production, subject to the allocation of costs in the final award
(d)          The arbitrator shall have the authority to award the same damages and other relief that would have been available in court pursuant to the law governing the Dispute(s)
(e)          Either party shall have the right to file motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment/adjudication
(f)           The arbitrator shall have the authority to issue an award or partial award without conducting a hearing on the grounds that there is no claim on which relief can be granted or that there is no genuine issue of material fact to resolve at a hearing
(g)          The Federal Rules of Evidence shall apply to all arbitration proceedings
(h)          The arbitrator must issue a decision in writing, setting forth in summary form the reasons for the arbitrator’s determination and the legal basis therefor
(i)            The arbitrator’s authority shall be limited to deciding the case submitted by the parties to the arbitration
 Therefore, no decision by any arbitrator shall serve as precedent in other arbitrations except to preclude the same claim from being re-arbitrated between the same parties
(j)            The parties may settle any dispute on a mutual basis without involvement of the arbitrator
(k)           If You initiate arbitration, You will pay the first $250, and GameStop will pay all other filing, administrative, or hearing fees
 If You are an individual person and GameStop initiates arbitration, GameStop will pay all filing, administrative, and hearing fees
 Regardless of which party initiates arbitration, You will remain responsible for Your attorneys’ fees and costs unless the law governing the Dispute(s) provides for an award of attorneys’ fees and costs and the arbitrator determines as part of the arbitration award that You may recover a certain amount of attorneys’ fees and costs

Redemption of Points and Point-Management Preferences 
Points may be redeemed for reward certificates of various denominations

Reward certificates of the same value are not stackable
Offers and reward certificates are not valid on prior purchases, certain products and services, purchase of gift cards, downloadable content ("DLC"), or for tax or state fees
Other restrictions may apply
Reward certificate and offer expiration dates are as listed on each certificate or offer, and reward certificates will not be replaced if lost or stolen
The timing of when reward certificates are issued is governed by the reward preferences a Member sets and their point balance
A Member may elect to save or “stockpile” their points to use in the Rewards Center or to have their points auto-redeemed for reward certificates
This reward preference can be managed from the Member’s dashboard once they log in at www.PowerUpRewards.com
Unless a Member updates their reward preferences the following preferences are applied by default: 
Player Members, Pro Members, and Elite Members save or “stockpile” their points
All settings that have been manually managed by the Member will persist when a membership status changes between Player, Pro, and Elite Pro
If a Member’s preference is not manually selected and a default is used, the default setting will adjust to stockpile points, should a Member upgrade or downgrade their status
GameStop may also change the available Member settings, at its sole discretion and without prior notice, so that redemption of future points and reward certificates will be handled in a different manner
Such changes will not affect previously accumulated points
PowerUp Rewards Center 
In addition to reward certificates, Members may redeem points for items in the PowerUp Rewards Center by visiting www.PowerUpRewards.com
The Rewards Center is subject to change at any time without notice in GameStop’s sole discretion
GameStop also reserves the right to make different offers to different Members at different points in time
GameStop may, from time to time, elect to automatically redeem a Member’s points for a particular reward selected by GameStop from the then current Rewards Center
Members redeeming points for merchandise outside of GameStop stores will receive an email confirmation including instructions for redemption
Partner coupons are provided by and are the responsibility of the partner
GameStop assumes no responsibility for their continued validity or the continued operation of the partner
Reservations

Reservations are cancellable before or up to 30 days after Release Date to receive your money (or original form of tender; e.g., a gift card or store credit) back, apply the Reservation to a new reservation-eligible product, or use the Reservation as store credit
Reservations not redeemed or cancelled within 30 days after Release Date are automatically converted into non-expiring store credit redeemable only for merchandise from GameStop
No cash redemption or refunds except as required by law
No fees are charged against the balance of Reservation
If used without your permission, Reservations will not be replaced

Privacy Policy 
The information provided by or collected about You both online and/or in a GameStop retail store is subject to and will be handled according to the GameStop Privacy Policy, available at and subject to periodic update at https://www.gamestop.com/PrivacyPolicy.html
Changes to the Program and the Terms and Conditions 
GameStop may change the Program Terms and Conditions, in whole or in part, at any time without notice, even though changes may affect the value of the points already accumulated
The Terms and Conditions available at https://www.gamestop.com/TermsConditions.html replace all previously-published information and Members have the responsibility to check for any updates

DISPUTE RESOLUTION 
PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY - IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS AND GOVERNS HOW YOU AND GAMESTOP CAN BRING CLAIMS AGAINST EACH OTHER
 THIS SECTION WILL, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION, REQUIRE YOU AND GAMESTOP TO SUBMIT CLAIMS AGAINST EACH OTHER TO BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS
 THIS MEANS THAT YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BRING A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE LAWSUIT IN A COURT OF LAW BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY OR TO APPEAL DECISIONS CONCERNING ANY DISPUTE THAT MAY ARISE WHICH IS COVERED BY THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND ARE INSTEAD AGREEING TO SUBMIT ANY SUCH DISPUTE SOLELY ON YOUR OWN BEHALF TO AN IMPARTIAL ARBITRATOR
INFORMAL RESOLUTION: You and GameStop will first attempt to resolve any claim informally
 Accordingly, neither you nor GameStop may start a formal arbitration proceeding for at least 60 days after one party notifies the other party of a claim in writing
 As part of this informal resolution process, You must deliver Your written notices via hand or first-class mail to us at GameStop, Attn: Guest Care, 625 Westport Parkway Grapevine, Texas 76051
GOVERNING LAW: You and GameStop agree that these Terms and any Dispute you may have with GameStop, will be governed by federal law and the Federal Arbitration Act as to arbitration issues and the law of the State of Texas for all other issues, without reference to the principles of conflicts of laws thereof
You agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (1980) and Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA), as adopted by any state, are specifically excluded from application to this Agreement
WE BOTH AGREE TO ARBITRATE:  You and GameStop agree to resolve any dispute between you and GameStop or its affiliates (“Dispute”) through final and binding arbitration, with two exceptions
 First to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate our intellectual property rights (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) or to the extent that you believe we have violated or threatened to violate your intellectual property rights
 Under such circumstances we or you may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above
  Second, you may bring any matter within the jurisdiction of a small claims court or similar court in which you seek less than $10,000 in a small claims court or similar court on an individual basis without a class action
WHAT IS ARBITRATION: You and GameStop mutually agree to forego the delay and expense of using a court of law and choose instead to benefit from the speedy, economical, and impartial dispute resolution procedure of using binding arbitration for Disputes that arise between You and GameStop, its related and affiliated companies, successors, and assigns; and/or any current or former employee, officer, or director of GameStop or any related or affiliated company
 Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court and seeks to resolve disputes more quickly
Instead of a judge or a jury, the case will be decided by a neutral arbitrator who has the power to award the same damages and relief that a court can
 If any provision of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision shall be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms shall be enforced
You and GameStop agree that this Dispute Resolution Section is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C
§ 1 et seq., and will survive even if these Terms and Conditions terminate
 Any revision to or termination of the Terms & Conditions that modify or terminate this Dispute Resolution Section shall not apply to a pending arbitration, to any claim that accrued prior to the modification or termination, or to any claim that the asserting party knew about prior to the modification or termination, except as may be required by applicable law
WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL: THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration
Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court
 In the event any litigation should arise between You and us in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND GAMESTOP WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT YOU MAY CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY IN DECIDING TO ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE
NO CLASS ACTIONS: Except as otherwise required under applicable law, You and GameStop agree to arbitrate any Dispute only on an individual basis and hereby waive any right to bring, participate in, or receive money or any other relief from any representative, class, consolidated, or collective proceeding  (“Class Action Waiver”)
  No party may bring a claim on behalf of other individuals, and no arbitrator hearing any claim under these Terms and Conditions may: (a) without the consent of all parties, combine more than one individual’s claim or claims into a single case; (b) order, require, participate in, or facilitate production of class-wide contact information or notification of others of potential claims; or (c) arbitrate any form of a class, collective, consolidated, representative, or private attorney general proceeding
WHO DECIDES WHAT CAN BE ARBITRATED: If a party violates the agreement to arbitrate by commencing an action asserting a Dispute in a court of law, then the court (and not an arbitrator) shall have the authority to resolve any disputes about the interpretation, formation, existence, enforceability, validity, and scope of this Dispute Resolution Section
 If a party complies with the agreement to arbitrate and files for arbitration without filing a complaint in a court of law, then the arbitrator shall have the authority to resolve any disputes about the interpretation of this Dispute Resolution Section for purposes of discovery or the merits of the underlying claim, but shall have no authority to resolve any disputes about the formation, existence, enforceability, or validity of this Dispute Resolution Section, including the Class Action Waiver
WHAT ARE THE ARBITRATION RULES, PROCEDURES, AND COSTS: To initiate arbitration, the party desiring to pursue a legal dispute must prepare a written demand setting forth the claim(s) and deliver the written demand within the applicable statute of limitations period by hand or first class mail to the AAA and us at GameStop, Attn: General Counsel, 625 Westport Parkway Grapevine, Texas 76051
You and GameStop agree that the arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) before a single arbitrator mutually agreed upon by the parties, and if the parties cannot agree within thirty (30) days after names of potential arbitrators have been proposed, then by a single arbitrator who is chosen by AAA
 Except to the extent that they are modified by the rules below, if You are an individual person, the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules that are in effect at the time of the filing of the demand (and that are available at https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer_Rules_Web_0.pdf) will apply
The parties agree that the applicable AAA rules are modified as follows: 
(a)          Any arbitrator must be neutral as to all parties
 Standards for the recusal of an arbitrator shall be the same standards under which trial judges are recused under Texas law
 Unless you prefer otherwise and GameStop agrees, the arbitration shall be conducted in the county in which you reside
 Or if that is not practicable, in an adjacent county as determined by AAA
(b)          No party is entitled to its attorneys’ fees, except as may be awarded in a matter authorized by and consistent with applicable law
(c)           All discovery shall be subject to any and all objections available under FRCP 26(b)
 Each party shall avoid broad or widespread collection, search, and production of documents, including electronically stored information (“ESI”)
 If a compelling need is demonstrated by the requesting party, the production shall: (i) be narrowly tailored in scope; (ii) only come from sources that are reasonably accessible without undue burden or cost; and (iii) be produced in a searchable format, if possible without undue burden or cost, and which is usable by the receiving party and convenient and economical for the producing party
 Where the costs and burdens of the requested discovery outweigh its likely benefit, considering the needs of the case, the amount in controversy, and the importance of the discovery in resolving the issues, the arbitrator shall deny such requests or order production on condition that the requesting party advance to the producing party the reasonable costs involved in making the production, subject to the allocation of costs in the final award
(d)          The arbitrator shall have the authority to award the same damages and other relief that would have been available in court pursuant to the law governing the Dispute(s)
(e)          Either party shall have the right to file motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment/adjudication
(f)           The arbitrator shall have the authority to issue an award or partial award without conducting a hearing on the grounds that there is no claim on which relief can be granted or that there is no genuine issue of material fact to resolve at a hearing
(g)          The Federal Rules of Evidence shall apply to all arbitration proceedings
(h)          The arbitrator must issue a decision in writing, setting forth in summary form the reasons for the arbitrator’s determination and the legal basis therefor
(i)            The arbitrator’s authority shall be limited to deciding the case submitted by the parties to the arbitration
 Therefore, no decision by any arbitrator shall serve as precedent in other arbitrations except to preclude the same claim from being re-arbitrated between the same parties
(j)            The parties may settle any dispute on a mutual basis without involvement of the arbitrator
(k)           If You initiate arbitration, You will pay the first $250, and GameStop will pay all other filing, administrative, or hearing fees
 If You are an individual person and GameStop initiates arbitration, GameStop will pay all filing, administrative, and hearing fees
 Regardless of which party initiates arbitration, You will remain responsible for Your attorneys’ fees and costs unless the law governing the Dispute(s) provides for an award of attorneys’ fees and costs and the arbitrator determines as part of the arbitration award that You may recover a certain amount of attorneys’ fees and costs
If any term or condition in this Dispute Resolution Section is determined to be unenforceable or in conflict with a mandatory provision of applicable law, it shall be construed to incorporate any mandatory provision, or the unenforceable or conflicting term or condition shall be automatically severed and the remainder of this Dispute Resolution Section shall not be affected
 Provided, however, that if the Class Action waiver is found to be unenforceable, then any claim brought on a class, collective, or representative action basis shall be adjudicated exclusively in the state and federal courts located in the County of Tarrant, Texas, which shall be the exclusive forum for such claims
 You waive any and all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction over You by such courts and to venue in such courts
