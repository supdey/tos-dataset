BlackBerry is committed to ensuring continuity of adequate protection and lawful Processing of personal data regardless of the jurisdiction.  BlackBerry may transfer your personal data outside of your country to a subsidiary, a third-party service provider, or business partner to operate our business and to fulfill the purposes described in this Notice.  By using our websites or providing any personal data to us, where applicable law permits and unless otherwise specified in a separate specific notice, you consent to the transfer, Processing, and storage of such information outside of your country of residence where data protection standards may be different
We will always seek to localize personal data when possible
Several lawful bases exist for BlackBerry to ensure adequacy of data protection when engaging in cross border transfers.  
BlackBerry is a Canadian company headquartered in Waterloo, Ontario
For lawful transfers of personal data to Canada from the EU, BlackBerry relies on the European Union’s recognition of the adequacy of Canada’s Privacy law, the Personal Information and Electronic Documents Act (“PIPEDA”) as a lawful basis for the transfer of personal data, which governs how BlackBerry can collect, use, and disclose personal data.  Since 2001, PIPEDA has given Canada the benefit of an adequacy decision by the European Commission and transfers on the basis of an adequacy determination are authorized pursuant to Article 45 of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”).  This decision is an acknowledgement by the Commission that PIPEDA affords an adequate level of personal data protection to customers that entrust personal data to BlackBerry
As a Data Processor under GDPR, BlackBerry regularly executes with its EU customers or customers with GDPR compliance obligations (Data Controllers) Data Protection Addenda that incorporate the EU’s Standard Contractual Clauses to ensure an adequate level of protection throughout the data Processing lifecycle.  This includes BlackBerry’s use of third-party service providers, who are required to Process personal data under comparable terms and conditions
We are committed to ensuring that your personal data is secure
We take commercially reasonable measures, including physical, administrative and technical safeguards, to protect your personal data from unauthorized access, use, alteration, destruction and disclosure
To find out more about our security practices, see our Privacy Notice Frequently Asked Questions
We retain your personal data for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected and for a reasonable period thereafter to comply with our legal obligations, and contractual and business operational requirements
;With relation to personal data collected by our products and services, we retain information during the term of the agreement, based upon instructions provided by our customers, or for shorter periods of time as described in the applicable Product Notice or other product or service documentation
When personal data is no longer necessary or relevant for BlackBerry’s identified purposes, or required by applicable laws, BlackBerry will take steps to have it deleted, destroyed, erased, aggregated or made anonymous
Consistent with good business practice, BlackBerry continues to evolve our controls, schedules and practices for information and records retention and destruction which apply to your personal data
Non-personal data, such as samples of potentially malicious software or anonymized data, may be retained indefinitely for the purpose of improving the performance of our products and services

At BlackBerry we aim to provide the transparency you need to exercise your rights
Below you will find information on your personal data rights as well as how to make requests
If you are a resident in the European Economic Area and covered by the GDPR, BlackBerry is the Data Controller of your personal data, except where our products and services have been deployed within an organization, such as your workplace or business, where BlackBerry would then act as a Data Processor under the GDPR
