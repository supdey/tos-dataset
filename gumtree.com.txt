If we believe that you are breaching these Terms of Use in any way and/or behaving suspiciously on Gumtree,
we may, at our discretion, inform other Gumtree users that have been in contact with you and recommend that they exercise caution.
Gumtree and the Gumtree community work together to keep Gumtree working properly and the community safe.
Please report problems, offensive content and policy breaches to us using the reporting system.
Without limiting other remedies, we may issue warnings, limit or terminate our service, remove hosted
content and take technical and legal steps to keep users off Gumtree if we think that they are creating problems,
infringing the rights of third parties or acting inconsistently with the letter or spirit of our policies
(including, without limitation, circumventing temporary or permanent suspensions or harassing the Gumtree employees or other users).
However, whether we decide to take any of these steps, remove hosted content or keep a user off Gumtree or not, we do not have any
obligation to monitor the information transmitted or stored on Gumtree and we do not accept any liability for unauthorised or unlawful
content on Gumtree or use of Gumtree by users.
Some of Gumtree's features may display your ad on other sites, services, applications or tools (together a “Platform”)
that are part of the Gumtree community, or on third party Platforms,
including social media channels
By using Gumtree, you agree that your ads can be displayed on these other Platforms and media channels.
You may be subject to additional laws or other restrictions in the
countries where your ad is posted
When your ad is posted on another Platform, you may be responsible for ensuring that it does not violate
such other Platform’s policies
We may remove your ad if it is reported on Gumtree,, or any third party Platform, or if we
believe it causes problems or violates any law or policy.
Using Gumtree is generally free, but we sometimes charge a fee for certain services
If the service you use incurs a fee,
you'll be able to review and accept terms that will be clearly disclosed at the time you post your ad
Our fees are quoted in
Pounds Sterling, and we may change them from time to time
We'll notify you of changes to our fee policy by posting such changes on Gumtree.
We may choose to temporarily change our fees for promotional events or new services; these changes are effective when we announce the promotional event or new service.
You are responsible for paying the Gumtree fees when they're due
If you don't, without prejudice to any other right or remedy we may
be entitled to under these Terms of Use or by law, we may limit your ability to use the services
If your payment method fails or your account
is past due, we may collect fees owed using other collection mechanisms.
You acknowledge that your ads may be deleted from Gumtree in case we believe these Terms of Use, including our Posting Rules, are breached,
either directly or indirectly
In case you would have paid a fee for the display of such ad, you may be entitled to a refund of such fee.
However, we reserve the right not to refund Gumtree users for any fees paid through use of Gumtree in the following cases:
If you breach, in our opinion, these Terms of Use, which include, without limitation, the Policies; 
If your ads went live with exposure on the Gumtree sites, services, applications or tools, even for a
limited time, and that they benefited from the service associated with the paid fee;
If your ads are placed in the Pets or Massage categories of Gumtree; 
If your ads are placed into "edit" mode and will go live to site once updated by you; 
If you have removed your ads yourself; 
If you post duplicate ads as defined in our rules regarding duplicate ads; 
If we believe that your ads are in a significantly wrong category; 
Please note that the above list is not exhaustive
See the Gumtree Refunds Help Page for more details
on the cases in which you may, or may not, be entitled to a refund of such fees.

involved or liable for any loss related to such transactions.

users’ location and search query / category selected; 
adverts' category, content, location and date published; and 
if the ad has a paid-for promotion (see our Payment & Promotions Help page for more information)

resulting from our negligence or the negligence of our agents or employees
You agree not to hold us responsible for
things other users post or do.

As most of the
content on Gumtree comes from other users, we do not guarantee the accuracy of postings or user communications or the
quality, safety, or legality of what's offered.
In no event do we accept liability of any description for the posting of any unlawful, threatening, abusive,
defamatory, obscene or indecent information, or material of any kind which violates or infringes upon the rights of
any other person, including without limitation any transmissions constituting or encouraging conduct that would
constitute a criminal offence, give rise to civil liability or otherwise violate any applicable law.

the service will be corrected

guarantee this and we do not give any promises or warranties (whether express or implied) about the operation and

express or implied, including those of quality, merchantability, merchantable quality, durability, fitness for a
particular purpose and those arising by statute
We are not liable for any loss, whether of money (including profit),
goodwill, or reputation, or any special, indirect, or consequential damages arising out of your use of, or inability
to use Gumtree, even if you advise us or we could reasonably foresee the possibility of any such damage occurring.
Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of warranties or exclusion of damages, so such disclaimers and
exclusions may not apply to you

or any third party (whether in contract, tort, negligence, strict liability in tort, by statute or otherwise) is
limited to the greater of (a) the total fees you paid to us in the 12 months prior to the action giving rise to
liability, and (b) 100 Pounds Sterling.
