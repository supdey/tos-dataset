The Web changes constantly, and no technique can ever index all pages accessible on the Web
As a result, Alexa
cannot guarantee the completeness or accuracy of the websites or URLs to which the Services link or refer
Further, the process of including websites in the Services is largely automatic
Alexa does not screen the
websites included in the Services, and these other websites are maintained by persons over whom Alexa exercises no
control
For these reasons, Alexa assumes no responsibility for the content of any website or URL included in the
Services and is not responsible for errors or omissions or for offensive or objectionable content contained on any
website or URL included in the Services
Instructions for restricting Alexa from crawling your site are available at Webmaster

ALEXA AND ITS AFFILIATES ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS
ALEXA AND ITS AFFILIATES MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS
OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE OPERATION OF THE SERVICES (INCLUDING THE TOOLBAR
SERVICE), OR THE INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS (INCLUDING SOFTWARE) OR OTHER SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR
OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THE SERVICES
YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES IS AT YOUR
SOLE RISK
TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY APPLICABLE LAW, ALEXA AND ITS AFFILIATES DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE
NEITHER ALEXA NOR ITS AFFILIATES WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES (INCLUDING THE TOOLBAR SERVICE), INFORMATION,
CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS (INCLUDING SOFTWARE) OR OTHER SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU
THROUGH THE SERVICES, ALEXA'S SERVERS OR ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS SENT FROM ALEXA ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER
HARMFUL COMPONENTS
NEITHER ALEXA NOR ITS AFFILIATES WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING FROM USE
OF THE SERVICES (INCLUDING THE TOOLBAR SERVICE), OR FROM ANY INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS (INCLUDING

CERTAIN STATE LAWS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN
DAMAGES
IF THESE LAWS APPLY TO YOU, SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS, OR LIMITATIONS MAY NOT
APPLY TO YOU, AND YOU MIGHT HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS
Any dispute or claim relating in any way to this agreement (including Alexa's Privacy Notice) or your
use
of any Services (including the Toolbar Service) will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in
court, 
except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify
The Federal Arbitration Act and
federal arbitration law apply to this agreement
There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited
However, an
arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and
declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of this agreement as a court would
To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to
our registered agent, Corporation Service Company, 2730 Gateway Oaks Drive, Suite 100, Sacramento, CA 95833
The
arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA's
Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes
The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling
1-800-778-7879
Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules
We
will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are
frivolous
Likewise, Alexa will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines
the claims are frivolous
You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written
submissions, or in person at a mutually agreed location
We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not
in a
class, consolidated or representative action
If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in
arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial
We also both agree that you or we may bring suit
in a state
or federal court in King County, Washington to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property
rights
By using any Services, you agree that the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the
state of Washington, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern this agreement (including
Alexa’s Privacy Notice) and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and Alexa
We reserve the right to make changes to the Services and this agreement at any time
We may amend any of this
agreement's terms and any of the Service Terms at our sole discretion by posting the revised terms on the Alexa
website
If any of these conditions shall be deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that condition
shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining condition
If you have a subpoena to serve on Alexa, please note that Alexa does not accept service via e-mail or fax and
will not respond to the subpoena
All subpoenas must be properly served on Alexa, preferably by mailing the
subpoena to Corporation Service Company (CSC), Alexa's national registered agent
