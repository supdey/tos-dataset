ACCESS AND USE OF THE SERVICES 
GoFundMe Services Description: The GoFundMe Services are offered as a platform to allow an individual, entity or non-profit organisation (the “Organiser”) to post a fundraiser (“Fundraiser”) to the GoFundMe Platform to accept monetary donations (“Donations”) from donors (“Donors”) on behalf of the beneficiary of the Fundraiser (“Beneficiary”)
Neither the Organiser nor the Fundraiser will provide goods or services in exchange for Donations.  
Payment Processor: GoFundMe is not a payment processor and does not hold any funds
Instead, GoFundMe uses third-party payment processing partners to process Donations for a Fundraiser(“Payment Processor”)
You acknowledge and agree that the use of Payment Processors are integral to the Services and that we exchange information with Payment Processors in order to facilitate the provision of Services
Transaction Fees: Although there are no fees to Organisers to set up a Fundraiser, please keep in mind that transaction fees, including credit and debit charges, are deducted from each donation (hereinafter and on the website referred to as “Transaction Fees”)
To learn more about the Platform and the applicable Transaction Fees , visit GoFundMe Pricing for personal fundraisers , and GoFundMe Pricing for Charity Fundraisers 
The Services are Platforms; We are not a Broker, Financial Institution, Creditor or Charity: The Services are administrative platforms only
GoFundMe facilitates the Fundraiser of the Organisers and permits Donors to make donations to these Fundraisers
GoFundMe is not a broker, agent, financial institution, creditor or 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation
All information and content provided by GoFundMe relating to the Services is for informational purposes only, and GoFundMe does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, timeliness or reliability of any such information or content
No content is intended to provide financial, legal, tax or other professional advice
Before making any decisions regarding any Fundraisers, Charities (defined hereinafter), Donations, Donors, or any information or content relating to the Services, you should consult your financial, legal, tax or other professional advisor as appropriate
You acknowledge that all information and content accessed by you using the Services is at your own risk
GoFundMe has no control over the conduct of, or any information provided by, a User and hereby disclaims all liability in this regard to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law
We do not guarantee that a Fundraiser will obtain a certain amount of Donations or any Donations at all
We do not endorse any Fundraiser, User, or cause and we make no guarantee, express or implied, that any information provided through the Services is accurate
We expressly disclaim any liability or responsibility for the outcome or success of any Fundraiser
You, as a Donor, must make the final determination as to the value and appropriateness of contributing to any User or Fundraiser
No Solicitation: The Platform is offered to help Organisers raise money
GoFundMe merely provides the technology to allow Fundraisers to connect with Donors
The existence of the Services is not a solicitation of donations by GoFundMe, and GoFundMe does not engage in any solicitation activities, or consult on the solicitation of contributions from the public, on behalf of any individual, entity or organisation
By using the Services, you understand and agree that GoFundMe shall not be responsible for the use of your Donations or the amount of funds raised for the User or Fundraiser

We do not and cannot verify the information that Users or Fundraisers supply, nor do we represent or guarantee that the Donations will be used in accordance with any fundraising purpose prescribed by a User or Fundraiser or in accordance with applicable laws
Notwithstanding the foregoing, we take possible fraudulent activity and the misuse of funds raised very seriously
You can learn more about our Fraud Policy

If you are a Donor, you may also be covered by the GoFundMe Guarantee 
A
Donors are not permitted to impose restrictions on the use of Donations by a non-profit organisation, established as such under the applicable laws of incorporation (“Charity”) 
To the extent that a Donation is made in response to an appeal for a particular programme of a Charity, or to the extent that a Donor purports to direct the use of Donations by a Charity, any such directions shall constitute non-binding recommendations only and the Charity shall have full discretion to determine how all Donations will be used
B
GoFundMe makes no representation as to whether all or any portion of your Donations, including, if any, Transaction Fees, are tax deductible or eligible for tax credits
GoFundMe will have no liability for any claim by any national, federal, state, regional, provincial, territorial, local or any other tax authority with respect to the characterisation on any applicable tax return of any Donation by you, any User or any Charity

You, as a Donor, represent and warrant to GoFundMe that such information is true, current and accurate and that you are authorised to use the applicable Payment Instrument
You agree that a certain minimum Donation amount may apply, and that all Donations are final and will not be refunded unless GoFundMe, in its sole discretion, agrees to issue a refund, for example in accordance with the GoFundMe Guarantee

Account Holds: From time to time, GoFundMe may, in its sole discretion, place a hold on a Fundraiser account (a “Hold”), restrict Withdrawals (defined herein as the transfer of Funds raised to Beneficiary), initiate a reverse ACH transfer, secure reserves, or take similar actions to protect its interests and those of its Users
Some of the reasons that we may take such actions include, but are not limited to, our belief or determination, in our sole and absolute discretion, that: (i) information provided by an Organiser is false, misleading, or fraudulent, or funds are being used in a prohibited manner, (ii) the funds available should be provided directly to a person other than the Organiser, such as a legal beneficiary or person entitled by law to act on behalf of an Organiser, (iii) a Fundraiser or Organiser has violated these Terms of Service, (iv) the Organiser is colluding with Donors to engage in fraudulent activity, (v) there may be suspicious or fraudulent Donation activity, or (vi) such action(s) is required to comply with a court order, subpoena, writ, injunction, or as otherwise required under applicable laws and regulations
If you have questions about a Hold we may have placed on your Fundraiser account, or need information about how to resolve the Hold, please see this article 
Withdrawing Donations from a Fundraiser: While GoFundMe strives to make Withdrawals available to you promptly, you acknowledge and agree that: (i) Withdrawals may not be available to you for use immediately, (ii) GoFundMe does not guarantee that Withdrawals will be available to you within any specific time frame, and (iii) GoFundMe expressly disclaims any and all responsibility for any delay in Withdrawals or your inability to access and use Withdrawals at any specified time, and any consequences arising from such delay or inability

GoFundMe may, at any time, for any reason, without notice, and in its sole discretion, offer or issue a refund of Donation(s) with or without consulting with you, which may comprise the entire amount donated to your Fundraiser
GoFundMe is not liable to you or to any third party for any claims, damages, costs, losses, or other consequences caused by GoFundMe issuing refunds, including, but not limited to transaction or overdraft fees
PAYMENT PROCESSORS  
GoFundMe uses Payment Processors to process Donations for your Fundraiser and thereafter deliver it to you
In order to withdraw funds from a Fundraiser, an Organiser or, if not the same, Beneficiary (collectively “Withdrawing Entity”) will be required to provide the Payment Processor information regarding bank account information (“Withdrawing Account”)
You, as Withdrawing Entity, represent and warrant to Payment Processor and GoFundMe that such information is true and that you are authorised to use the applicable Withdrawing Account.  
By setting up a Fundraiser or accepting the role of Beneficiary to a Fundraiser, the Withdrawing Entity agrees to the processing, use, transfer or disclosure of data by the Payment Processors pursuant to these Terms of Services as well as any and all applicable terms set forth by the applicable Payment Processors
Our current Payment Processors include: Adyen LLC ( Adyen’s terms of service ), Stripe, Inc

Payment Processors for Charities: GoFundMe has partnered with PayPal and, in limited circumstances, Adyen or Stripe, for Donations to Charities
Although exceptions can be made, Charities in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and Australia will be defaulted to using PayPal to process Donations made through the Services
The manner in which transactions are processed is explained below
Charities in other countries will be defaulted to using Adyen or Stripe
A
PayPal
i
PayPal is the Payment Processor for Fundraisers with a Charity identified as a Beneficiary.  
ii
In the United States, all Donations made through those Fundraisers will be accepted by PayPal Giving Fund, a grant-giving IRS-registered 501(c)(3) public charity
PayPal Giving Fund receives Donations from Users as the charity of record and then, to the extent it is able, grants Funds to the Charity selected by the Organiser and identified in the Fundraiser
While PayPal Giving Fund takes multiple steps to attempt to grant donated funds according to the Donor’s identified preference, PayPal Giving Fund retains exclusive control over all Donations
If a Charity fails to meet the terms of PayPal Giving Fund’s Non-profit Certification Policy and/or fails to meet PayPal Giving Fund’s due diligence standards for receipt of a donation at any time, PayPal Giving Fund may reassign the funds in accordance with its policy here 
When PayPal Giving Fund receives your Donation, it will forward the Donation to the Charity of your choice, but PayPal Giving Fund will appear on your tax receipt
Donations made through PayPal Giving Fund are governed by the Privacy Policy and User Agreement of PayPal Giving Fund and PayPal 
iii
PayPal Giving Fund has foreign counterparts, which are also registered charities in those countries
For example, if an Organiser in the United Kingdom starts a Fundraiser for a Charity in the United Kingdom, then PayPal will act as the Payment Processor with PayPal Giving Fund UK receiving the Donations.  Thereafter, PayPal Giving Fund UK will grant funds to the Charity identified in the Fundraiser, to the extent it is able, and it will issue country dependent tax documentation for all Donations received through it.   
B
Adyen or Stripe
When Adyen or Stripe processes a Donation through the Services for a Charity, the Donation will go directly from the Donor to the Charity’s merchant account
Donations will appear on the Donor’s credit card statement under the name of the Charity to whic the Donor contributed
For more information, see AdyenTerms and Conditions or Stripe’s services agreement

DISPUTES 
ARBITRATION CLAUSE & CLASS ACTION WAIVER – IMPORTANT – PLEASE REVIEW AS THIS AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS 
Arbitration; Class (Group) Action Waiver
YOU AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US OR ANY OF OUR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS OR EMPLOYEES ACTING IN THEIR CAPACITY AS SUCH (WHETHER OR NOT SUCH DISPUTE INVOLVES A THIRD PARTY) WITH REGARD TO YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH US, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DISPUTES RELATED TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, AND/OR RIGHTS OF PRIVACY AND/OR PUBLICITY, WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU AND WE HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY
DISCOVERY AND RIGHTS TO APPEAL IN ARBITRATION ARE GENERALLY MORE LIMITED THAN IN A LAWSUIT, AND OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU AND WE WOULD HAVE IN COURT MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION
YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND WE ARE EACH WAIVING OUR RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS (GROUP) ACTION
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in these Terms of Service will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either of us to (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable national, federal, state, regional or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (d) file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim
The Process
Any arbitration between you and us will be settled under the US Federal Arbitration Act and administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, “AAA Rules”) as modified by these Terms of Service
The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org 
A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified US Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“Notice of Arbitration”)
Our current address for Notice is: GoFundMe, Inc., Attention: Legal Department, 855 Jefferson Avenue, PO Box 1329, Redwood City, CA 94063, USA
The Notice of Arbitration must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”)
We agree to work with you and make a good faith effort to resolve the claim directly, but if we aren’t successful within 60 days after the Notice of Arbitration has been received, you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding
All arbitration proceedings between the parties will be confidential unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing
During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by either of us must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any
If the arbitrator awards you an amount which exceeds the last written settlement amount offered by us in settlement of the dispute prior to the award, we will pay to you the higher of: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator; or (ii) US $10,000.00
Fees
If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms of Service, we will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee unless your claim is for more than $10,000 in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules
Any arbitration hearing will take place at an agreed upon location in San Francisco, California, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a telephone hearing or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county of your billing address
If the arbitration finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in the US Federal Rule of Civil procedure 11(b), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules
In that case, you agree to reimburse us for all monies previously disbursed by us that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules
Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based
The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits
No Class (Group) Actions
YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS TO THE FULLEST EXTENT LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS (GROUP) MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS (GROUP) OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING
Further, unless both you and we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class (group) proceeding
Modifications to this Arbitration Provision: If we make any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to our address for Notice of Arbitration, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to our address for Notice of Arbitration, in which case your account with us will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive
Enforceability
If this Disputes section is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Disputes section will be null and void and, in that case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in the General section below will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms of Service
Confidentiality
We each agree to keep the arbitration proceedings, all information exchanged between us, and any settlement offers confidential, unless otherwise required by law or requested by law enforcement or any court or governmental body
However, we may each disclose these matters, in confidence, to our respective accountants, auditors, and insurance providers
TERMINATION 
You agree that GoFundMe, in its sole discretion, may suspend or terminate your account (or any part thereof) or your access to the Services and remove and discard any User Content or data at any time and for any reason, with or without notice, and without any liability to you or to any third party for any claims, damages, costs or losses resulting therefrom
USER DISPUTES 
You agree that you are solely responsible for your interactions with any other user in connection with the Services and GoFundMe will have no liability or responsibility with respect thereto
GoFundMe reserves the right, but has no obligation, to become involved in any way with disputes between you and any other user of the Services
GENERAL 
These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between you and GoFundMe and govern your use of the Services, superseding any prior agreements between you and GoFundMe with respect to the Services
You also may be subject to additional terms of service that may apply when you use affiliate or third-party services, third-party content or third-party software
These Terms of Service will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions
With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, as set forth above, you and GoFundMe agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within San Mateo County, California, USA
The failure of GoFundMe to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision
If any provision of these Terms of Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be (or are otherwise) invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavour to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms of Service remain in full force and effect
You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Services or these Terms of Service must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred
