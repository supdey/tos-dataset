	This Registration Agreement ("Agreement") sets forth the terms and conditions of your use of domain name registration and related services ("Services")
In this Agreement "you" and "your" refer to you and the registrant listed in the WHOIS contact information for the domain name
"We", "us" and "our" refer to the registrars listed at the bottom of this document , any one of which will be the registrar for your domain name and all of which share common ownership, common terms and conditions, and a shared Services infrastructure
To determine which registrar your domain name is registered with, perform a WHOIS lookup at http://www.uwhois.com 
You obtain the Services first through a Primary Service Provider, Afternic, Inc., with whom we have a wholesale relationship
Your relationship with your Primary Service Provider may be governed by additional terms, as you and your Primary Service Provider may agree

	SERVICE(S) PROVIDED AT WILL AND TERMINATION OF SERVICE(S): We and your Primary Service Provider may reject your domain name registration application or elect to discontinue providing Service(s) to you for any reason within 30 days of a Service initiation or a Service renewal
Outside of this period, we and your Primary Service Provider may terminate or suspend the Service(s) at any time for cause, which, without limitation, includes registration of prohibited domain name(s), abuse of the Services, payment irregularities, serious allegations of illegal conduct, or if your use of the Services involves us in a violation of any Internet Service Provider's ("ISP's") acceptable use policies, including the transmission of unsolicited bulk email
You agree that if we terminate or suspend the Services provided to you under this Agreement, that we may then, at our option, make either ourselves or a third party the beneficiary of Services which are substantially similar to those which were previously providing to you and that any reference in this Agreement to termination or suspension of the Services to you includes this option
If we have grounds to terminate or suspend Service(s) with respect to one domain name or in relation to other Service(s) provided through your account, we may terminate or suspend all Service(s) provided through your account, including Service(s) to other domain names
No fee refund will be made when there is a suspension or termination of Service(s) for cause
At any time and for any reason, we may terminate the Services 30 days after we send notice of termination via mail or email, at our option, to the WHOIS contact information provided in association with your domain name registration
Following notice of termination other than for cause, you must transfer your domain name or risk that we may delete your domain name or suspend or modify Services to it
If we terminate Services for a reason other than cause, we will attempt to refund your fees
You further acknowledge and agree that your registration of a domain name is subject to suspension, cancellation or transfer by any ICANN procedure, by any registrar or registry administrator procedures approved by an ICANN-adopted policy, to correct mistakes by us, another registrar or the registry administrator in administering the domain name or for the resolution of disputes concerning the domain name.
	OUR SERVICES: We are accredited registrars with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ("ICANN") for Top Level Domain Names ("TLDs") (such as .com, .net, .org, .de, co.uk, etc.)
ICANN oversees registrations and other aspects of the TLDs
Domain name registrations are not effective until the registry administrator puts them into effect
For a list of registry administrators and for more information on TLDs, see HYPERLINK http://www.icann.org/tlds/
Domain name registrations are only for limited terms, terms which end on the expiration date
For domain names which are created as a new registration out of the available namespace, the term begins on the date the domain name registration is acknowledged by the applicable registry; for domain names registrations which were not returned to the available namespace, the term begins on the date the previous registrant's domain name registration was acknowledged by the applicable registry
You agree that we and your Primary Service Provider are not liable or responsible in any way for any errors, omissions or any other actions by the registry administrator arising out of or related to a request to register, renew, modify the settings for, or transfer of a domain name registration (our limitation of liability is explained further, below)
You further agree that domain name registration is a service, that domain name registrations do not exist independently from services provided pursuant to this or a similar registration agreement with a registrar, and that domain name registration services do not create a property interest.
	YOU WARRANT THAT YOUR USE OF OUR SERVICES IS NOT GOING TO SUBJECT US TO ANY CLAIM(S)
You further agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless us, your Primary Service Provider, and applicable registry administrator(s) (including Verisign Inc., Neulevel, Inc., Public Interest Registry, Afilias Limited, and other registry operators listed at http://www.icann.org/registries/listing.html) and all such parties' directors, officers, employees, and agents from and against any and all claims, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including any direct, indirect, incidental, special or consequential damages and reasonable legal fees and expenses) arising out of, or related to, the domain name registration services you are obtaining from us.
	NOT INCLUDED IN THE SERVICES: Without limitation, the following are not included in the Services: We cannot and do not check to see whether the domain name(s) you select, or the use you make of the domain name(s), or other of the Service(s), infringes legal rights of others
It is your responsibility to know whether or not the domain name(s) you select or use infringes legal rights of others
We might be ordered by a court to cancel, modify, or transfer your domain name; it is your responsibility to list accurate contact information in association with your account and to communicate with litigants, potential litigants, and governmental authorities
It is not our responsibility to forward court orders or other communications to you
We will comply with court orders unless you contact us to contest the order.
	IF LAWSUIT(S) ARE THREATENED: If we are sued or threatened with lawsuit in connection with Service(s) provided to you, we may turn to you to indemnify us and to hold us harmless from the claims and expenses (including attorney's fees and court costs)
Under such circumstances, you agree that you will, upon demand, obtain a performance bond with a reputable bonding company or, if you are unable to obtain a performance bond, that you will deposit money with us to pay for our reasonably anticipated expenses in relation to the matter for the coming year
Such deposit will be drawn down as expenses are incurred, with all account notices sent to the WHOIS contact information provided in association with your domain names and/or account
We shall not be obliged to extend you any credit in relation to such expenses and we may terminate the Services for a failure to make or renew such a deposit
We will return any unused deposit upon the later of one year from deposit or the conclusion of the matter.
	DISPUTE RESOLUTION POLICY: You agree to the Uniform Domain NameDispute Resolution Policy ("UDRP"), which is available at http://www.icann.org/udrp/udrp-rules-24oct99.htm and http://www.icann.org/dndr/udrp/policy.htm 
You agree that the UDRP may be changed by ICANN (or ICANN's successor) at any time
You agree that, if the registration or reservation of your domain name is challenged by a third party, you will be subject to the provisions specified in the Dispute Policy in effect at the time your domain name registration is disputed by the third party
You also agree that, in the event a domain name dispute arises with any third party, you will indemnify and hold us harmless pursuant to the terms and conditions of the UDRP
You also understand that it is important for you to regularly monitor email sent to the email address associated with your account and domain names because, among other reasons, if a dispute arises regarding Services provided to you, you may loose your rights to receive the Services if you do not respond expeditiously to an email sent in conjunction therewith.
	FEES: As consideration for the Service(s), renewal of the Service(s), and, if you select it, automatic renewal of the Service(s), you agree to pay, prior to the effectiveness of the desired Service(s), the applicable Service(s) fees
All fees are non-refundable, in whole or in part, even if your domain name registration is suspended, cancelled or transferred prior to the end of your then current registration term, unless this Agreement specifically provides for a refund
At our option, we may require that you pay fees through a particular payment means (such as by credit card or by wire transfer) or that you change from one payment provider to another.
	CREDIT CARD AND OTHER CHARGES: If you have an issue with credit card charges, you should contact your Primary Service Provider (if any), first, and us, secondarily, regarding the issue before you contact your credit card company to request a charge back or reversal of the charges
In the event of a charge back by a credit card company (or similar action by another payment provider allowed by us) in connection with your payment of fees for any Service(s), you agree that we and/or your Primary Service Provider may suspend access to any and all accounts you have with us and/or your Primary Service Provider and that all rights to and interest in and use of any domain name registration(s) services, website hosting, and/or email services, including all data hosted on our systems and/or on the systems of your Primary Service Provider shall be assumed by us or your Primary Service Provider, as the case may be

Reinstatement of Service(s) by your Primary Service Provider may be according to the terms, if any, between you and your Primary Service Provider relating to reinstatement
Charges for the Service(s) which use our credit card payment processor will be identified on your credit card statement as "Domain Name Registration." We are not responsible for how charges appear on your credit card statement when the transaction is processed by your Primary Service Provider's or another third party's credit card payment processor.
	EXPIRATION AND RENEWAL OF SERVICE(S): You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to keep your own records and to maintain your own reminders regarding when your domain name registration or other Services are set to expire
As a convenience to you, and not as a binding commitment, we and/or your Primary Service Provider may notify you via an email message or via your account when renewal fees are due
Should these fees go unpaid, your Services will expire or be cancelled
Payment must be made by credit card or such other method as we may allow or require from time to time
If you select automatic renewal of the Service(s), we may attempt to renew the Service(s) a reasonable time before expiration, provided your credit card or other billing information is available and up to date
You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to keep your billing information up to date and that we are not required to, but that we may, contact you to update this information in the event that an attempted transaction is not processed successfully.
	ACCOUNT CONTACT INFORMATION AND DOMAIN NAME WHOIS INFORMATION: As further consideration for the Service(s), you agree to provide certain current, complete and accurate information about you, both with respect to your account information and with respect to the WHOIS information for your domain name(s)
You agree to maintain and update this information as needed to keep it current, complete and accurate
With respect to you, the administrative, technical, and billing contacts for your domain name registration(s) and other Service(s), you must submit the following: name, postal address, e-mail address, voice telephone number, and where available, fax number
You agree that the type of information you are required to provide may change and you understand that, if you do not provide the newly required information, your registration or and/or other Service(s) may be suspended or terminated or may not be renewed
Not providing requested information may prevent you from obtaining all Service(s)
You may provide information regarding the name-servers assigned to your domain name(s) and, if we are providing name-server services to you, the DNS settings for the domain name
If you do not provide complete name-server information, or if you purchase "Name Only" Services, you agree that we may supply this information (and point your domain name to a website of our choosing) until such time as you elect to supply the name-server information or until such time as you elect to upgrade from "Name Only" Services.
	YOUR OBLIGATIONS AND REPRESENTATIONS RELATING TO THE ACCOUNT AND WHOIS CONTACT INFORMATION: In the event that, in registering a domain name or obtaining other Service(s), you provide information about or on behalf of a third party, you represent that you have (a) provided notice to that third party of the disclosure and use of that party's information as set forth in this Agreement, and (b) that you have obtained the third party's express consent to the disclosure and use of that party's information as set forth in this Agreement
By registering a domain name or applying for other Service(s) you also represent that the statements in your application are true and you also represent that the domain name is not being registered or the Services being procured for any unlawful purpose
You acknowledge that providing inaccurate information or failing to update information promptly will constitute a material breach of this Agreement and will be sufficient basis for suspension or termination of Services to you
You further agree that your failure to respond for over ten (10) calendar days to inquiries by us concerning the accuracy of account and WHOIS contact information shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement and will be sufficient basis for suspension or termination of Service(s) to you
As indicated elsewhere in this Agreement, you understand that it is important for you to regularly monitor email sent to the email address associated with your account and WHOIS contact information because, among other reasons, if a dispute arises regarding a domain name(s) or other Service(s), you may loose your rights to the domain name(s) or your right to receive the Service(s) if you do not respond appropriately to an email sent in conjunction therewith.
	ACCESSING YOUR ACCOUNT AND AN IMPORTANT LIMITATION OF OUR LIABILITY: In order to change any of your account or domain name WHOIS information, you must access your account with your Primary Service Provider (if any), or your account with us
Please safeguard your account login identifier and password from any unauthorized use
You agree that any person in possession of you account login identifier and password will have the ability and your authorization to modify your account and domain name information
We will take reasonable precautions to protect the information we obtain from you from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration or destruction of that informationand that such reasonable precautions include procedures for releasing account access information to parties who claim to have lost account access information
You agree that, if we take reasonable precautions in relation thereto, that IN NO EVENT SHALL WE BE LIABLE IF SUCH REASONABLE PRECAUTIONS DO NOT PREVENT THE UNAUTHORIZED USE OR MISUSE OF YOUR ACCOUNT IDENTIFIER OR PASSWORD AND THAT, EVEN IF WE FAIL TO TAKE REASONABLE PRECAUTIONS, THAT OUR LIABILITY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL BE LIMITED BY THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY PROVISION FOUND BELOW IN THIS AGREEMENT
If you contact us alleging that a third party has unauthorized access to your account or domain names, you agree that we may charge you administrative fees of $50 (US dollars) per hour for our time spent in relation to the matter, regardless of whether or not we return control over the account and/or domain names to you.
	TRANSFERS: You agree that transfer of your domain name(s) services shall be governed by ICANN's transfer policy, available at http://www.icann.org/transfers/, as this policy may be modified from time to time
You agree that we may place a "Registrar Lock" on your domain name services and that this will prevent your domain name services from being transferred without your authorization, though we are not required to do so
By allowing your domain name services to remain locked, you provide express objection to any and all transfer requests until the lock is removed
To transfer your domain name(s) you should first login to your account to lock or unlock your domain name(s) and/or to obtain the EPP "AuthCode" which is required to transfer domain services in an EPP registry (such as .org)
Alternatively, you should contact your Primary Service Provider to have your domain name(s) services locked or unlocked or to obtain the EPP "AuthCode." If your Primary Service Provider is unresponsive, you may contact us to have your domain name(s) locked or unlocked or to obtain the EPP "AuthCode" though we may first contact your Primary Service Provider to request that the Primary Service Provider address the request
Only the registrant and the administrative contacts listed in the WHOIS information may approve or deny a transfer request
Without limitation, domain name services may not be transferred within 60 days of initial registration, within 60 days of a transfer, if there is a dispute regarding the identity of the domain name registrant, if you are bankrupt, or if you fail to pay fees when due
We will follow the procedures for both gaining and loosing registrars as outlined in ICANN's transfer policies
Transfer requests typically take five business days to be processed
A transfer will not be processed if, during this time, the domain name registration services expire in which event you may need to reinstate the transfer request
You may be required to resubmit a transfer request if there is a communication failure or other problem at either our end or at the registry
AS A CONSEQUENCE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU ASSUME ALL RISK FOR FAILURE OF A TRANSFER IF THE TRANSFER PROCESS IS INITIATED CLOSE TO THE END OF A REGISTRATION TERM.
	PRIVACY POLICY: You agree and consent that we will make available the domain name registration information you provide or that we otherwise maintain to the following parties: ICANN, the registry administrator(s), and to other third parties as ICANN and applicable laws may require or permit (including through web-based and other on-line WHOIS lookup systems), whether during or after the term of your domain name registration services of the domain name
You hereby irrevocably waive any and all claims and causes of action you may have arising from such disclosure or use of such information
Additionally, you acknowledge that ICANN may establish or modify the guidelines, limits and/or requirements that relate to the amount and type of information that we may or must make available to the public or to private entities, and the manner in which such information is made available
Information regarding ICANN's guidelines and requirements regarding WHOIS can be found at http://www.icann.org/registrars/wmrp.htm, http://www.icann.org/registrars/wdrp.htm, and elsewhere on the ICANN website at http://www.icann.org/index.html

	USE OF FREE SERVICES: In consideration for providing additional optional Services for which we do not charge an additional fee, including, but not limited to, URL forwarding, email forwarding, free parking page, free website hosting, free email services, or other services which we may introduce from time to time but for which there is not a separate fee ("Free Services"), you agree that, if you use such Free Services, we may display advertising in conjunction therewith through the use of pop-up or pop-under browser windows, banner advertisements, audio or video steams, appendices to emails, or other similar advertising means, and that we may aggregate related usage data by means of cookies and other similar means
You agree that from time to time we may provide you with free or low-cost domain name(s) services ("Promotional Name(s)")

If you do not want the Promotional Name services, you may request that you be removed as the registrant of such Promotional Names and we will be listed as the domain name registrant
Alternatively, you may contact us or your Primary Service Provider to request that we delete the Promotional Name from the namespace
For any domain name services, including these Promotional Names, for which you are listed as registrant but for which you do not pay the registration or renewal fee, you agree that we may assign name-servers to the domain name and point the domain name to IP address(es) designated by us until the registration or renewal fee is paid.
	AFTER EXPIRATION OF THE TERM OF A DOMAIN NAME REGISTRATION: After expiration of the term of a domain name registration services and before deletion of the domain name in the applicable registry's database, you acknowledge that we may direct the domain name to name-servers and IP address(es) designated by us, including, without limitation, to no IP address or to IP address(es) which host a parking page or a commercial search engine that may display advertisements, and you acknowledge that we may either leave your WHOIS information intact or that we may change the contact information in the WHOIS output for the expired domain name so that you are no longer the listed registrant of the expired domain name.
	After expiration of the term of domain name registration services, you acknowledge that certain registry administrators may provide procedures or grace periods during which expired domain name registrations may be renewed
You acknowledge that you assume all risks and all consequences if you wait until close to or after the end of a domain name registration term to attempt to renew the registration
You acknowledge that we, for any reason and in our sole discretion, may choose not to participate in a post-expiration renewal of a domain name and that we shall not be liable therefore
You acknowledge that post-expiration renewal or redemption processes, if any, involve additional fees which we and your Primary Service Provider may determine
You acknowledge and agree that expired domain name(s) may be made available to be registered or re-registered to any party at any time.
	You agree that after expiration of the term of a domain name registration we may, for a period of 30 days, either i) remove the domain name from the zone of the top-level-domain (meaning that the domain name will no longer resolve), or ii) direct the domain name to name-servers and IP address(es) of website(s) designated by us, including, without limitation, to IP address(es) which host a parking page or a commercial search engine
You agree that either are functionally equivalent to ICANN's or a registry's redemption grace period, which would normally occur after deletion
If we exercise our rights under this provision, and if you do not transfer the domain name services to another registrar nor contact us to pay for and renew the domain name prior to the end of the 30 days, you agree that you have abandoned the domain name.
	After this 30 day period, you agree that we may either (i) delete the domain name at any time thereafter or (ii) that we may pay the registry's registration free or otherwise allow it to continue to be registered with the WHOIS information previously provided by you and pointing to the name-server(s) and IP address(es) designated by us, and that we will not remove it from the TLD zone
In the latter event, the domain name will be designated as being in the extended redemption grace period ("ERGP"), and you will be allowed to assume, during the first 120 days of the then extant registration term, complete management of the domain name services, including the right to control the DNS information, provided that you pay a fee of $160 (US dollars)
After the end of the 120-day period, if you do not exercise your rights under this provision, you agree that you have abandoned the domain name services, and relinquish all rights and use of the domain name services, and that you are no longer the registrant of the domain name, and that we may list ourselves or another party as the registrant of the domain name in the WHOIS information
If we exercise our rights under this provision and you do not wish to be listed as the registrant and you wish to forego your option under this provision to pay to renew the domain name registration services for the then-current registration term, you may notify us before the end of the 120-day period and request that we remove your information from the WHOIS record for the domain name, in which case we, or a third party we designate, will be listed as the registrant, and in which case you relinquish all rights and control over the domain name services, and in which case we may i) continue to point the domain name to IP address(es) designated by us, or ii) we may delete the domain name from the applicable registry's database.
	Alternatively, if you do not contact us to renew the domain name registration services during the 30 day period described above, you agree that we may (i) delete the domain name at any time thereafter or (ii) we may put the domain name up for auction pursuant to the terms of our Pre-Release Names auction service, or (iii) pay the registry fee or otherwise allow it to continue to be registered with the WHOIS information previously provided by you and pointing to the name-server(s) and IP address(es) designated by us, and that we will not remove it from the TLD zone
In the latter event, the name will be designated as being in the extended redemption grace period ("ERGP"), and you will be allowed to assume, during the first 90 days of the then extant registration term, complete management of the domain name services, including the right to control the DNS information, provided that you pay a fee of $200 (US dollars)
After the end of the 90-day period, if you do not exercise your rights under this provision, you agree that you have abandoned the domain name services, and relinquish all rights and use of the domain name services, and that you are no longer the registrant of the domain name, and that we may list ourselves or another party as the registrant of the domain name in the WHOIS information
If we exercise our rights under this provision and you do not wish to be listed as the registrant and you wish to forego your option under this provision to pay to renew the domain name registration services for the then-current registration term, you may notify us before the end of the 90-day period and request that we remove your information from the WHOIS record for the domain name, in which case we, or a third party we designate, will be listed as the registrant, and in which case you relinquish all rights and control over the domain name services, and in which case we may i) continue to point the domain name to IP address(es) designated by us, or ii) we may delete the domain name from the applicable registry's database.
