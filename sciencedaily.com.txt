Miscellaneous 
No subscription fees: Personal use of ScienceDaily and affiliated sites is free of charge at this time
Therefore our policy is to never request credit card, password or other personal or financial information of site users
Privacy Policy 
Most web sites collect some sort of information about their visitors in order to gather statistics about how many visitors they get each month, what are the most and least popular pages on the web site, where there may be problems in serving certain pages to visitors, etc
In an effort to answer questions such as these, ScienceDaily also collects certain basic information about its visitors
Please note, however, that ScienceDaily has no interest in personally identifying its users
This would be practically quite difficult, and quite an unnecessary task to accomplish anyway
The only thing that ScienceDaily is interested in is the overall statistics of its readership
Cumulative figures that provide a picture of visitor traffic to our site are vital in our efforts to attract advertisers--upon whose support the site depends--and to monitor how well our web server is keeping up with our ever-increasing readership
So what information does ScienceDaily collect about its visitors? Each time someone visits the site, our web server logs a number of details--if they are available--including the IP address of the visitor's computer and/or Internet service provider, the domain name and country of origin of that computer, its operating system, and the type of web browser being used
In addition to the statistics that our own web server collects, the third-party advertising agencies that we work with may also collect certain information through the use of banner ads
Third-Party Advertising 
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site
These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you
Third-Party Cookies 
In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser
If you wish not to have ScienceDaily keep any records of your visit to our site, even though it is our policy not to personally identify individual users but only to gather overall cumulative information about our visitors, then we suggest that you use an anonymous web browsing service such as Anonymizer.com
Such services typically hide all information about particular users from web sites, which log visits from the anonymizing service instead of the users' own computers
If you have any questions about our privacy policy, please contact Dan Hogan, editor of ScienceDaily, editor@sciencedaily.com
Copyright and Take-Down Procedures 
If you think that any Content accessible on ScienceDaily or affiliated sites infringes on your copyright, you may request removal of those materials by e-mailing Dan Hogan, ScienceDaily's editor, at editor@sciencedaily.com
Please include "copyright question" in the subject line and the URL of the material, your name, address, phone number and e-mail address in the body of the message
If you violate any of these Terms and Conditions, your permission to use the Content automatically terminates and you must immediately destroy any copies you have made of any portion of the Content.
